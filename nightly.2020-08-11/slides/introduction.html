<h2>Scheduling Forecast Suites<a class="headerlink" href="../html/introduction.html#scheduling-forecast-suites" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>Environmental forecasting suites generate forecast products from a
potentially large group of interdependent scientific models and
associated data processing tasks. They are constrained by availability
of external driving data: typically one or more tasks will wait on real
time observations and/or model data from an external system, and these
will drive other downstream tasks, and so on. The
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-dep-one"><span class="std std-ref">dependency diagram</span></a> for a single forecast cycle point in
such a system is a <em>Directed Acyclic Graph</em> (in our terminology, a
<em>forecast cycle point</em> is comprised of all tasks with a common <em>cycle point</em>,
which is the nominal analysis time or start time of the forecast
models in the group). In real time operation processing will consist of
a series of distinct forecast cycle points that are each initiated, after a
gap, by arrival of the new cycle point’s external driving data.</p>
<p>From a job scheduling perspective task execution order in such a system
must be carefully controlled in order to avoid dependency violations.
Ideally, each task should be queued for execution at the instant its
last prerequisite is satisfied; this is the best that can be done even
if queued tasks are not able to execute immediately because of resource
contention.</p>

<article class="slide level-2" id="ecoconnect">

<h2>EcoConnect<a class="headerlink" href="../html/introduction.html#ecoconnect" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>Cylc was developed for the EcoConnect Forecasting System at NIWA
(National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, New Zealand).
EcoConnect takes real time atmospheric and stream flow observations, and
operational global weather forecasts from the Met Office (UK), and uses
these to drive global sea state and regional data assimilating weather
models, which in turn drive regional sea state, storm surge, and
catchment river models, plus tide prediction, and a large number of
associated data collection, quality control, preprocessing,
post-processing, product generation, and archiving tasks <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id2">[1]</a>.
The global sea state forecast runs once daily. The regional
weather forecast runs four times daily but
it supplies surface winds and pressure to several downstream models that
run only twice daily, and precipitation accumulations to catchment river
models that run on an hourly cycle assimilating real time stream flow
observations and using the most recently available regional weather
forecast. EcoConnect runs on heterogeneous distributed hardware,
including a massively parallel supercomputer and several Linux servers.</p>

<h3>Intra-cycle Dependence<a class="headerlink" href="../html/introduction.html#intra-cycle-dependence" title="View HTML">§</a></h3>

<p>Most dependence between tasks applies within a single forecast cycle
point. Below is the dependency diagram for a single
forecast cycle point of a simple example suite of three forecast models
(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em>) and three post processing or product generation
tasks (<em>d</em>, <em>e</em> and <em>f</em>). A scheduler capable of handling this
must manage, within a single forecast cycle point, multiple parallel
streams of execution that branch when one task generates output for
several downstream tasks, and merge when one task takes input from several
upstream tasks.</p>

<em>d</em>, <em>e</em> and <em>f</em> are post processing or product generation
tasks, and <em>x</em> represents external data that the upstream
forecast model depends on.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Consider the optimal job schedule for two consecutive cycle points of the
example suite in real time operation, given execution times represented by
the horizontal extent of the task bars:</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">A single cycle point job schedule for real time operation.

example suite during real time operation, assuming that all tasks
trigger off upstream tasks finishing completely. The horizontal
extent of a task bar represents its execution time, and the vertical
blue lines show when the external driving data becomes available.</span></p>
</div>
<p>There is a time gap between cycle points as the suite waits on new external
driving data. Each task in the example suite happens to trigger off
upstream tasks <em>finishing</em>, rather than off any intermediate output
or event; this is merely a simplification that makes for clearer
diagrams.</p>
<p>Now the question arises, what happens if the external driving data for
upcoming cycle points is available in advance, as it would be after a
significant delay in operations, or when running a historical case
study?  While the forecast model <em>a</em> appears to depend only on the
external data <em>x</em> at this stage of the discussion, in fact it would
typically also depend on its own previous instance for the model
<em>background state</em> used in initializing the new forecast. Thus, as
alluded to in this graph of two linked cycles, task <em>a</em> could in principle
start as soon as its predecessor has finished:</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">What if the external driving data is available early? If the external

</div>
<p>The resulting overlapping job schedule shows, however, that starting a whole
new cycle point at this point is dangerous - it results in dependency
violations in half of the tasks in the example suite:</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id13">

schedules. A naive attempt to overlap two consecutive cycle
points using the single-cycle-point dependency graph. The red shaded

</div>
<p>In fact the situation could be even worse than this
- imagine that task <em>b</em> in the first cycle point is delayed for some
reason <em>after</em> the second cycle point has been launched. Clearly we must
consider handling inter-cycle dependence explicitly or else
agree not to start the next cycle point early:</p>

<article class="slide level-3" id="inter-cycle-dependence">

<h3>Inter-Cycle Dependence<a class="headerlink" href="../html/introduction.html#inter-cycle-dependence" title="View HTML">§</a></h3>

<p>Forecast models typically depend on their own most recent previous
forecast for background state or restart files of some kind (this is
called <em>warm cycling</em>) but there can also be inter-cycle dependence
between different tasks. In an atmospheric forecast analysis suite, for
instance, the weather model may generate background states for observation
processing and data-assimilation tasks in the next cycle point as well as for
the next forecast model run. In real time operation inter-cycle
dependence can be ignored because it is automatically satisfied when one cycle
point finishes before the next begins. If it is not ignored it drastically
complicates the dependency graph by blurring the clean boundary between
cycle points.</p>
<p>The problem is illustrated for our simple example suite
assuming minimal inter-cycle dependence; the warm cycled models (<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>,
and <em>c</em>) each depend on their own previous instances:</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id15">
<span id="fig-dep-multi"></span><img alt="_images/dep-multi-cycle.png" src="_images/dep-multi-cycle.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The complete multi-cycle-point dependency graph.
The complete dependency graph for the example suite, assuming
the least possible inter-cycle dependence: the forecast models (<em>a</em>,
<em>b</em>, and <em>c</em>) depend on their own previous instances. The dashed arrows
show connections to previous and subsequent forecast cycle points.</span></p>
</div>
<p>For this reason, and because we tend to see forecasting suites in terms of
their real time characteristics, other metaschedulers have ignored
inter-cycle dependence and are thus restricted to running entire cycle
points in sequence at all times. This does not affect normal real time
operation but it can be a serious impediment when advance availability of
external driving data makes it possible, in principle, to run some tasks from
upcoming cycle points before the current cycle point is finished - as was
suggested at the end of the previous section. This can occur, for instance,
after operational delays (late arrival of external data, system maintenance,
etc.) and to an even greater extent in historical case studies and parallel
test suites started behind a real time operation. It can be a serious problem
for suites that have little downtime between forecast cycle points and
therefore take many cycle points to catch up after a delay. Without taking
account of inter-cycle dependence, the best that can be done, in
general, is to
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-job-no-overlap"><span class="std std-ref">reduce the gap between cycle points to zero</span></a>.
A limited crude overlap of the single cycle point job schedule may be
possible for specific task sets but the allowable overlap may change if new
tasks are added, and it is still dangerous: it amounts to running different
parts of a dependent system as if they were not dependent and as
such it cannot be guaranteed that some unforeseen delay in
one cycle point, after the next cycle point has begun, (e.g. due to resource
contention or task failures) won’t result in dependency violations.</p>
<p>The optimal two cycle point job schedule, obtained by respecting all
inter-cycle dependence, would be:</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id16">
<span id="fig-optimal-two"></span><img alt="_images/timeline-two-cycles-optimal.png" src="_images/timeline-two-cycles-optimal.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The optimal two-cycle-point job schedule. The optimal two cycle job
schedule when the next cycle’s driving data is available in
advance, possible in principle when inter-cycle dependence is
handled explicitly.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Contrast this with the <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-overlap"><span class="std std-ref">naive overlapping job schedule</span></a>,
which assumes no delays due to resource contention or
otherwise - i.e. every task runs as soon as it is ready to run. The scheduler
running this suite must be able to adapt dynamically to external conditions
that impact on multi-cycle-point scheduling in the presence of
inter-cycle dependence or else, again, risk bringing the system down
with dependency violations.</p>
<p>To further illustrate the potential benefits of proper inter-cycle dependency
handling, consider the example of an operational delay of almost one whole
cycle point in a suite with little downtime between cycle points:</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id17">
<span id="fig-time-three"></span><img alt="_images/timeline-three.png" src="_images/timeline-three.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Comparison of job schedules after a delay. Job
schedules for the example suite after a delay of almost one whole
forecast cycle point, when inter-cycle dependence is
taken into account (above the time axis), and when it is not
(below the time axis). The colored lines indicate the time that
each cycle point is delayed, and normal “caught up” cycle points
are shaded gray.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id18">
<span id="fig-time-two"></span><img alt="_images/timeline-two.png" src="_images/timeline-two.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Optimal job schedule when all external data is
available. Job schedules for the example suite in case study
mode, or after a long delay, when the external driving data are
available many cycle points in advance. Above the time axis is the optimal
schedule obtained when the suite is constrained only by its true
dependencies, as depicted in the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-dep-two-linked"><span class="std std-ref">graph of two linked cycles</span></a>, and underneath
is the best that can be done, in general, when inter-cycle
dependence is ignored.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Above the time axis is the optimal schedule that is possible in
principle when inter-cycle dependence is taken into account, and below
it is the only safe schedule possible <em>in general</em> when it is ignored.
In the former case, even the cycle point immediately after the delay is hardly
affected, and subsequent cycle points are all on time, whilst in the latter
case it takes five full cycle points to catch up to normal real time
operation <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id3">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, consider <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-time-two"><span class="std std-ref">such example suite job schedules</span></a>
for an historical case study, or when catching up after a very long
delay; i.e. when the external driving data are available many cycle
points in advance. Task <em>a</em>, which as the most upstream forecast
model is likely to be a resource intensive atmosphere or ocean model,
has no upstream dependence on co-temporal tasks and can therefore run
continuously, regardless of how much downstream processing is yet to be
completed in its own, or any previous, forecast cycle point (actually,
task <em>a</em> does depend on co-temporal task <em>x</em> which waits on the
external driving data, but that returns immediately when the data is
available in advance, so the result stands). The other forecast models
can also cycle continuously or with a short gap between, and some
post processing tasks, which have no previous-instance dependence, can
run continuously or even overlap (e.g. <em>e</em> in this case). Thus,
even for this very simple example suite, tasks from three or four
different cycle points can in principle run simultaneously at any given time.</p>
<p>In fact, if our tasks are able to trigger off internal outputs of
upstream tasks (message triggers) rather than waiting on full completion,
then successive instances of the forecast models could overlap as well
(because model restart outputs are generally completed early in the forecast)
for an even more efficient job schedule <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id4">[3]</a>.</p>

<h2>The Cylc Scheduling Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="../html/introduction.html#the-cylc-scheduling-algorithm" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>Cylc manages a pool of proxy objects that represent the real tasks in a
suite (a “task pool”):</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id19">
<span id="fig-task-pool"></span><img alt="_images/task-pool.png" src="_images/task-pool.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The cylc task pool: how cylc sees a suite, in contrast to the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-dep-multi"><span class="std std-ref">multi-cycle-point dependency graph</span></a>.
Task colors represent different cycle points, and the small squares
and circles represent different prerequisites and outputs. A task
can run when its prerequisites are satisfied by the outputs
of other tasks in the pool.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Task proxies know how to run the real tasks that they represent,
and they receive progress messages from the tasks as they run (usually
reports of completed outputs). There is no global cycling mechanism to
advance the suite; instead individual task proxies have their own
private cycle point and spawn their own successors when the time is
right. Task proxies are self-contained - they know their own
prerequisites and outputs but are not aware of the wider suite.
Inter-cycle dependence is not treated as special, and the task pool can
be populated with tasks with many different cycle points. <em>Whenever any task
changes state due to completion of an output, every task checks to see
if its own prerequisites have been satisfied</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id9" id="id5">[4]</a>.
In effect, cylc gets a pool of tasks to self-organize by negotiating
their own dependencies so that optimal scheduling, as described in the
previous section, emerges naturally at run time.</p>
