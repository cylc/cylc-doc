.. _User Guide Configuration:

Workflow Configuration
======================

.. _FlowConfigFile:

The ``flow.cylc`` File
----------------------

Cylc workflows are defined in :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc` files that specify the
tasks to be managed by the Cylc scheduler, the dependencies between them,
and the schedules to run them to.

The ``.cylc`` file syntax is described in the :ref:`File Format Reference
<file-format>`.

The configurations you can use are documented in :ref:`workflow-configuration`.

.. _template processors: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor

Cylc also supports two `template processors`_ for use in the ``flow.cylc`` file:

* `Jinja2`_
* `EmPy`_


.. _WorkflowDefinitionDirectories:

Workflow Configuration Directories
----------------------------------

A Cylc :term:`source directory` contains:

:cylc:conf:`flow.cylc`
   The file which configures the workflow.

``bin/`` (optional)
   A directory for scripts and executables used by workflow tasks. It is
   added to ``$PATH`` in job environments.

   Jobs can also run scripting defined in the :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc` file,
   executables installed to user-defined locations of the workflow run
   directory, and external executables.

``lib/python/`` (optional)
   A directory for Python modules. It is added to ``$PYTHONPATH`` in
   the scheduler and job execution environments. It can be used by:

   - Tasks
   - Custom :ref:`job runners <CustomJobSubmissionMethods>`
   - Custom :ref:`Jinja2 Filters<CustomJinja2Filters>`

Other files and folders may be placed in the :term:`source directory` too:
documentation, configuration files, etc. When the workflow is :ref:`installed
<Installing-workflows>` these will be copied over to the :term:`run directory`.

.. note::

   If your workflow needs to create or install scripts or executables at runtime
   and you don't want Cylc to delete them on re-installation, you can use
   equivalent directories in the :ref:`workflow_share_directories`.


.. _UnderstandingCodeInCylcConfigurations:

Understanding Code in Workflow Configurations
---------------------------------------------

A workflow configuration is not executable code. It configures the scheduler
program to run your workflow. A `flow.cylc` file may contain:

- Embedded Python-like Jinja2 or EmPy templating code, such as
  ``{% set PLANET = "earth" %}``
- Bash shell variable assignments and scripting, such as
  ``script = "run-model.exe /path/to/data"``

Jinja2 (or EmPy) templating code gets executed as a preprocessing step, to
programmatically generate the workflow configuration for the scheduler.
To see the result after template processing:

.. code-block:: shell

    # print the workflow configuration, processed but not parsed:
    $ cylc view --process <workflow-id>

    # print the workflow configuration, processed and parsed:
    $ cylc config <workflow-id>


The scheduler does not interpret shell syntax, but certain string-valued
config items may contain shell code that gets written verbatim to job scripts,
to be executed by the running job.

Some things to be aware of:

- Jinja2 code is evaluated once when the workflow is started.
- Jinja2 code can only reference Jinja2 variables, not Cylc config items.
- Jinja2 (like Python) has its own syntax for reading environment variables.
- Jinja2 code that reads the environment or the filesystem will do so
  during config file parsing on the scheduler run host, not on job hosts.
  Beware of doing this in task definitions - do you want the scheduler
  environment to affect shell code that runs in the job environment?
- Shell code destined for the job script can read the environment or
  access the filesystem as the job runs on the job host, not on the
  scheduler host.


.. _SyntaxHighlighting:

Syntax Highlighting For Workflow Configuration
----------------------------------------------

Cylc provides syntax plugins for the following editors:

.. _language-cylc: https://github.com/cylc/language-cylc

Gross File Structure
--------------------

Cylc :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc` files consist of configuration items grouped under
several top level section headings:

:cylc:conf:`[meta]`
   Information about the workflow e.g. title and description.
:cylc:conf:`[scheduler]`
   Non task-specific workflow configuration.
:cylc:conf:`[task parameters]`
   Parameters for use when defining graphs and tasks.
   See :ref:`user guide param`.
:cylc:conf:`[scheduling]`
   Determines when tasks are ready to run.

   - special scheduling constraints e.g.
     :ref:`external triggers <Section External Triggers>`.
   - the dependency graph, which defines the relationships
     between tasks
:cylc:conf:`[runtime]`
   Determines how, where, and what to execute when tasks are ready

   - script, environment, job submission, remote hosting, etc.
   - workflow-wide defaults in the *root* family
   - a nested family hierarchy with common properties
     inherited by related tasks

.. _Validation:

Validation
----------

The ``cylc validate`` command evaluates the :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc` file
against a specification that defines all legal entries, values and options.
It also performs some integrity checks designed to catch certain configuration
issues and impossible scheduling constraints.

These checks are also performed by ``cylc play`` before starting a workflow.

All legal entries are documented in the :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc` reference.

If a :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc` file uses include-files ``cylc view`` will
show an inlined copy of the workflow with correct line numbers.

.. _cylc_lint_script:

Linting
-------

The ``cylc lint`` command checks code style, deprecated syntax and other
issues in Cylc configuration files.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`How to configure Cylc lint at project level <lint.pyproject.toml>`
   using a ``pyproject.toml``.

``cylc lint``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. automodule:: cylc.flow.scripts.lint

.. _lint.pyproject.toml:

Configure ``cylc lint`` at project level
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can configure ``cylc lint`` for each workflow using a
``pyproject.toml`` file.

To define settings for ``cylc lint`` use a ``[tool.cylc.lint]`` section.
Within the ``[tool.cylc.lint]`` section you may define the following:

``rulesets``
   A list of rulesets to use.

   Allowed values: ``'728'``, ``'style'``, ``'all'``.
   
   (You can override this on the command line.)

``ignore``
   Individual rules to ignore: A list of rule codes, such as ``S007``.

``exclude``
   A list of files or glob patterns for files which will not be checked.

``max-line-length``
   Set longest line length to permit in Cylc configs for this project.

   Default: ``130``.


.. note::

   .. versionchanged:: 8.3.0

      The ``[cylc-lint]`` section has been deprecated in favour of
      ``[tool.cylc.lint]``.

An example ``pyproject.toml`` might look like this:

.. code-block:: toml

   [tool.cylc.lint]
   # Enforce a line limit of 99 chars
   max-line-length = 99

   # Ignore style [S] rule 007 (It's good practice comment with a reason)
   ignore = ['S007']   # Family names start with lowercase in this workflow

   # Don't check files matching these globs
   exclude = ['history/*.old.cylc', 'someother.cylc']

   # By default check for style
   rulesets = ['style']

   [some-other-section]
   # Cylc lint won't pay any attention to this.
