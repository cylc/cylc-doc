.. Glossary Conventions - for consistency

   1) Linking to other glossary items in the text:
      - there's no need to link multiple instances of the same term in the same
        paragraph
      - but duplicate links may be desirable if further apart

   2) Examples can be given but should be brief and on point

   3) "seealso" blocks should contain, in order:
      - config reference links
      - glossary items not linked in the main text
      - documentation links (e.g. User Guide)
      - external web site links

      To avoid unnecessarily long lists and repetition don't duplicate glossary
      links from the main text

   4) To avoid surprising users by jumping out of the page, non-glossary links
      should:
      - primarily be in the "seealso" list
      - not look like another glossary term,
        e.g. :ref:`Cylc User Guide <blah>` not just :ref:`blah`.


.. TODO Add user guide and config links to all items, where appropriate.

   validation
   workflow validation
      Validation parses a ``flow.cylc`` file to report any illegal items,
      syntax errors, deprecation warnings, and other problems.

      It is done automatically at start up, and should be done manually with
      the ``cylc validate`` command after making changes.


   retry
      Tasks configured to retry on failure will return to the ``waiting`` state
      with a clock trigger to delay the next try.

      Any number of retries, with configurable delays between them, are possible.
      Task jobs can get their own try number from ``$CYLC_TASK_TRY_NUMBER``.

      If the final try fails, the task goes to the ``failed`` :term:`state
      <task state>`.

      .. seealso::

         * :ref:`Cylc User Guide <TaskRetries>`


   window
   n-window
   active window
   workflow window
      This is a :term:`graph`-based window or view of the workflow at runtime,
      including tasks out to ``n`` graph edges from current active tasks.

      .. seealso::

         * :ref:`Cylc User Guide <n-window>`


   artificial dependency
      An artificial :term:`dependency` in the :term:`graph` does not reflect
      real dependence between the tasks involved. This can sometimes be
      useful but should be avoided if possible. Artificial dependencies muddy
      the real dependencies of the workflow and they may unnecessarily
      constrain the scheduler.

      In the following :term:`cycling` workflow, if the task ``foo`` does not
      actually depend on any real outputs of ``bar`` in the previous cycle,
      then the intercycle dependence is artificial.

      .. code-block:: cylc

         P1 = """
            foo => bar => baz
            baz[-P1] => foo
         """


   workflow
   cylc workflow
      A workflow is a collection of :term:`tasks <task>` with
      :term:`dependencies <dependency>` among them that govern the order in
      which they can run.

      Cylc workflows are defined in :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc` files.

      For example, the following workflow represents the beer brewing process:

      .. code-block:: cylc
         :caption: flow.cylc

         [scheduling]
             cycling mode = integer
             initial cycle point = 1
             [[graph]]
                 # repeat this for each batch
                 P1 = """
                     # the stages of brewing in the order they must occur in:
                     malt => mash => sparge => boil => chill => ferment => rack

                     # finish the sparge of one batch before starting the next:
                     sparge[-P1] => mash
                 """

      .. admonition:: Cylc 7
         :class: tip

         In Cylc 7 and earlier "workflows" were referred to as "suites".


   workflow name
      The workflow name is a path relative to the cylc-run directory which
      contains one or more workflow :term:`run directories <run directory>`.

     Task jobs can get the workflow name from ``$CYLC_WORKFLOW_NAME`` in their
     runtime environment.

      Unlike :term:`workflow id` the name is not always a unique identifier. In
      the example below ``run1`` and ``run2`` would both have the same name,
      ``my_workflow``:

      .. code-block:: bash

         |- my_workflow
           |- runN
           |- run1
           |- run2

      .. note::
         If you are not using named or numbered runs, the workflow name will be
         the same as :term:`workflow id`.


   active waiting task
      An active waiting task is a task in the :term:`scheduler's <scheduler>`
      active window that is "actively waiting" on (i.e. periodically checking)
      an external trigger or clock trigger. These are the only waiting tasks
      that matter to the :term:scheduler in Cylc 8 (waiting tasks ahead of the
      active window are entirely abstract).


   workflow id
      A workflow can be uniquely identified by its :term:`run directory` path
      relative to the cylc-run directory.

      This ID is used on the command line and in the GUI, to target the right
      workflow.

      For example, the ID of the workflow in ``~/cylc-run/foo/bar/run1``
      is ``foo/bar/run1``.

      Unlike :term:`workflow name` the ID is always a unique identifier. In the
      example below each run has a different ID despite sharing the same
      :term:`workflow name` (``my_workflow``).

      .. code-block:: bash

         |- my_workflow
           |- runN
           |- run1      # CYLC_WORKFLOW_ID = my_workflow/run1
           |- run2      # CYLC_WORKFLOW_ID = my_workflow/run2


   graph
      A workflow graph is defined by one or more :term:`graph strings<graph string>`
      under the :cylc:conf:`[scheduling][graph]` section of a :term:`workflow<Cylc
      workflow>` definition.

      For example, the following is, collectively, a graph:

      .. code-block:: cylc

         P1D = foo => bar
         PT12H = baz

      .. digraph:: Example
         :align: center

         size = "7,15"

         subgraph cluster_1 {
             label = "2000-01-01T00:00Z"
             style = dashed
             "foo.01T00" [label="foo\n2000-01-01T00:00Z"]
             "bar.01T00" [label="bar\n2000-01-01T00:00Z"]
             "baz.01T00" [label="baz\n2000-01-01T00:00Z"]
         }

         subgraph cluster_2 {
             label = "2000-01-01T12:00Z"
             style = dashed
             "baz.01T12" [label="baz\n2000-01-01T12:00Z"]
         }

         subgraph cluster_3 {
             label = "2000-01-02T00:00Z"
             style = dashed
             "foo.02T00" [label="foo\n2000-01-02T00:00Z"]
             "bar.02T00" [label="bar\n2000-01-02T00:00Z"]
             "baz.02T00" [label="baz\n2000-01-02T00:00Z"]
         }

         "foo.01T00" -> "bar.01T00"
         "foo.02T00" -> "bar.02T00"


   graph string
      A graph string is a collection of task :term:`dependencies <dependency>`
      in the :cylc:conf:`[scheduling][graph]` section of a workflow definition,
      with an associated recurrence that defines its sequence of cycle points.

      The example below shows one graph string in a datetime cycling workflow,
      with a daily cycle point sequence:

      .. code-block:: cylc-graph

         R/^/P1D = """
            foo => bar => baz & pub => qux
            pub => bool
         """


   cycle
      In a :term:`cycling` workflow a cycle comprises one run of all
      :term:`tasks<task>` on a sequence of :term:`cycle points <cycle point>`
      defined by the same :term:`recurrence`.

      In simple cases you can think of a cycle as one of a series of repeat
      runs of a finite non-cycling workflow. However, Cylc gives each
      task its own individual :term:`cycle point` and can run tasks from
      multiple cycles at once. Nevertheless it is true that all tasks
      "belonging to" the same cycle have the same cycle point.

      For example, in the following workflow each dotted box represents a cycle
      and the :term:`tasks<task>` within it are the :term:`tasks<task>`
      belonging to that cycle. The numbers (i.e. ``1``, ``2``, ``3``) are the
      :term:`cycle points <cycle point>`.

      .. digraph:: Example
         :align: center

         size = "3,5"

         subgraph cluster_1 {
             label = "1"
             style = dashed
             "foo.1" [label="foo\n1"]
             "bar.1" [label="bar\n1"]
             "baz.1" [label="baz\n1"]
         }

         subgraph cluster_2 {
             label = "2"
             style = dashed
             "foo.2" [label="foo\n2"]
             "bar.2" [label="bar\n2"]
             "baz.2" [label="baz\n2"]
         }

         subgraph cluster_3 {
             label = "3"
             style = dashed
             "foo.3" [label="foo\n3"]
             "bar.3" [label="bar\n3"]
             "baz.3" [label="baz\n3"]
         }

         "foo.1" -> "bar.1" -> "baz.1"
         "foo.2" -> "bar.2" -> "baz.2"
         "foo.3" -> "bar.3" -> "baz.3"
         "bar.1" -> "bar.2" -> "bar.3"


   cycling
   cycling workflow
      A cycling :term:`workflow` in Cylc is defined by a graph of
      repeating tasks with individual :term:`cycle points <cycle point>`.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`cycle`


   cycle point
      The unique label given to tasks that belong to a particular :term:`cycle`.
      For :term:`integer cycling` these will be integers, e.g. ``1``, ``2``,
      ``3``, etc.
      For :term:`datetime cycling` they will be :term:`ISO8601` datetimes, e.g.
      ``2000-01-01T00:00Z``.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`initial cycle point`
         * :term:`final cycle point`
         * :term:`start cycle point`


   cycle point time zone
      The time zone used for task :term:`cycle points <cycle point>`.

      .. seealso::

         * :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc[scheduler]cycle point time zone`


   initial cycle point
      In a :term:`cycling workflow <cycling>` the initial cycle point is the
      first :term:`cycle point` in the :term:`graph`.

      .. seealso::

         * :cylc:conf:`[scheduling]initial cycle point`.
         * :term:`start cycle point`


   final cycle point
      In a :term:`cycling workflow <cycling>` the final cycle point, if there
      is one, is the last :term:`cycle point` in the :term:`graph`.

      .. seealso::

         * :cylc:conf:`[scheduling]final cycle point`.
         * :term:`stop cycle point`


   start cycle point
      In a :term:`cycling workflow <cycling>` the start cycle point is the
      :term:`cycle point` where the :term:`scheduler` :term:`starts <start>`
      running the workflow.

      This may be at or after the :term:`initial cycle point`.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`stop cycle point`
         * :ref:`Cylc User Guide <start_stop_cycle_point>`


   stop cycle point
      The stop cycle point is the :term:`cycle point` where :term:`scheduler`
      stops running the workflow and :term:`shuts down <shutdown>`.

      This may be at or before the :term:`final cycle point`.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`start cycle point`
         * :ref:`Cylc User Guide <start_stop_cycle_point>`


   integer cycling
      An integer :term:`cycling workflow` uses integer :term:`cycle points
      <cycle point>` and :term:`recurrences <recurrence>` (e.g. ``P3`` means
      every third cycle).

      .. seealso::

         * :cylc:conf:`[scheduling]cycling mode`
         * :term:`datetime cycling`
         * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-integer-cycling>`


   datetime cycling
      A datetime :term:`cycling` workflow uses
      :term:`ISO8601 datetime <ISO8601 datetime>` :term:`cycle points <cycle
      point>` (e.g.  ``2000-01-01T00:00Z``) and :term:`recurrences
      <recurrence>` (e.g. ``P3D`` means every third day).

         * :term:`integer cycling`
         * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-datetime-cycling>`


   wallclock time
      The actual time (in the real world).

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`datetime cycling`
         * :term:`clock trigger`


   ISO8601
      ISO8601 is an international standard for writing datetimes, durations,
      and :term:`recurrences <recurrence>` (sequences of datetimes). Cylc uses
      ISO8601 for :term:`datetime cycling`.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`ISO8601 datetime`
         * `Wikipedia (ISO8601) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_
         * `International Organisation For Standardisation
           <https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html>`_
         * `a summary of the international standard date and time notation
           <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Emgk25/iso-time.html>`_


   ISO8601 datetime
      A datetime written in the :term:`ISO8601` format, e.g:

      * ``2000-01-01T00:00Z``: midnight on the 1st of January 2000, UTC.

      .. seealso::

         * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-iso8601-datetimes>`


   ISO8601 duration
      A duration written in the ISO8601 format e.g:

      * ``PT1H30M``: one hour and thirty minutes.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`ISO8601`
         * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-iso8601-durations>`


   recurrence
      In a :term:`cycling workflow<cycling>` a recurrence determines the
      sequence of cycle points given to task instances that appear in the
      associated :term:`graph string`.

      Recurrences for :term:`datetime cycling` are based on the :term:`ISO8601`
      standard. Those for :term:`integer cycling` are designed to have similar
      syntax, but are much simpler.


   clock trigger
      Clock triggers connect cycle points to the :term:`wallclock time`, in
      :term:`datetime cycling` workflows. Tasks that depend on a clock trigger
      will not trigger until the wallclock time is equal to their cycle point
      plus or minus some offset.

      .. seealso::

         * :ref:`Cylc User Guide <Built-in Clock Triggers>`
         * :ref:`Cylc Tutorial <tutorial-cylc-clock-trigger>`


   intercycle dependence
   intercycle dependency
   intercycle trigger
      In a :term:`cycling workflow <cycling>`, intercycle dependence refers to
      a :term:`task` dependending on other tasks at different cycle points.

      For example, in the following workflow the task ``bar`` depends on
      its own previous instance:

      .. code-block:: cylc

         [scheduling]
             initial cycle point = 1
             cycling mode = integer
             [[graph]]
                 P1 = """
                     foo => bar => baz
                     bar[-P1] => bar
                 """

      .. digraph:: Example
         :align: center

         size = "3,5"

         subgraph cluster_1 {
             label = "1"
             style = dashed
             "foo.1" [label="foo\n1"]
             "bar.1" [label="bar\n1"]
             "baz.1" [label="baz\n1"]
         }

         subgraph cluster_2 {
             label = "2"
             style = dashed
             "foo.2" [label="foo\n2"]
             "bar.2" [label="bar\n2"]
             "baz.2" [label="baz\n2"]
         }

         subgraph cluster_3 {
             label = "3"
             style = dashed
             "foo.3" [label="foo\n3"]
             "bar.3" [label="bar\n3"]
             "baz.3" [label="baz\n3"]
         }

         "foo.1" -> "bar.1" -> "baz.1"
         "foo.2" -> "bar.2" -> "baz.2"
         "foo.3" -> "bar.3" -> "baz.3"
         "bar.1" -> "bar.2" -> "bar.3"


   qualifier
      A qualifier is appended to :term:`task` and :term:`family` names in 
      :term:`triggers <trigger>` in the :term:`graph`, to specify what task
      outputs must be completed for the associated :term:`dependency` to be
      satisified.

      For example, in ``foo:start => bar``, the ``start`` output of task ``foo``
      must be completed to satisfy the trigger.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`task triggers <task trigger>`
         * :term:`family triggers <family trigger>`
         * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-qualifiers>`


   future trigger
      A future trigger makes one task depend on another with a later 
      :term:`cycle point`.
     
      Here, ``bar.1`` triggers off ``foo.2``; and ``bar.2`` off of
      ``foo.3``; and so on:

      .. code-block:: cylc

         [scheduling]
             initial cycle point = 1
             cycling mode = integer
             [[graph]]
                 P1 = "foo[+P1] => bar"

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`intercycle trigger`


   task
      A task represents an activity in a :term:`workflow`. The workflow
      definition specifies how tasks depends on other tasks, what they
      should do, how and where to run them, and details of their
      runtime environment.

      Task definitions are used to create a :term:`job script` that is
      executed as a :term:`job` on behalf of the task.

      Tasks submit :term:`jobs <job>`. Each :term:`job` belongs to one task,
      but one task can submit multiple :term:`jobs <job>`.


   task state
      A :term:`task` progresses through a series of states in its lifetime.
      These include the ``submitted`` state after :term:`job` submission;
      ``running`` after execution commences, and ``succeeded`` after
      successful job execution.

      .. seealso::

         * :ref:`Cylc User Guide <task-job-states>`
         * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-tasks-and-jobs>`


   implicit task
      Implicit tasks appear in the :term:`workflow` :term:`graph` but are not
      defined under :cylc:conf:`[runtime]`. (They do inherit from the ``root``
      :term:`family`, however).
     
      Implicit tasks submit real jobs that just exit without doing anything
      useful. They may be useful placeholders during workflow development but
      are not allowed by default because they can be created accidentally by
      simply misspelling a task name in the graph or under ``[runtime]``.

      Here ``bar`` is implicit:

      .. code-block:: cylc

         [scheduling]
             [[graph]]
                 R1 = foo & bar
         [runtime]
             [[foo]]
         # eof

      .. seealso::

         * :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc[scheduler]allow implicit tasks`
         * :ref:`Cylc User Guide <ImplicitTasks>`

      .. admonition:: Cylc 7
         :class: tip

         In Cylc 7 and earlier implicit tasks were known as "naked dummy tasks".


   work directory
      Cylc executes task :term:`jobs <job>` inside a job-specific working
      directory, automatically created under the workflow :term:`run
      directory`.

      .. code-block:: sub

         <run-directory>/work/<cycle-point>/<task-name>

      Task jobs can get their own work directory path at runtime from
      the ``CYLC_TASK_WORK_DIR`` environment variable or the Posix ``pwd``
      command.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`run directory`
         * :term:`share directory`


   share directory
      Cylc automatically creates a share directory inside the workflow
      :term:`run directory` as a place to store files that need to be
      shared between tasks.

      .. code-block:: sub

         <run-directory>/share

      Task jobs can get their own share directory path at runtime from
      the ``CYLC_WORKFLOW_SHARE_DIR`` environment variable.

      In cycling workflows files are typically stored in cycle point
      sub-directories of the share directory.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`run directory`
         * :term:`work directory`


   workflow log
   scheduler log
   workflow log directory
      At runtime the scheduler logs timestamped events and other information to
      files under the workflow :term:`run directory`;

      * ``log`` - workflow events and user interaction
      * ``file-installation-log`` - log of file installation on remote platforms

      .. code-block:: sub

         <run-directory>/log/workflow/


   job log
   job log directory
      Task :term:`job` log files are stored in job specific log directories
      under the workflow :term:`run directory`. These include:

      - ``job`` - the task :term:`job script`
      - ``job.out`` - job stdout
      - ``job.err`` - job stderr
      - ``job.status`` - job status data in case of lost contact with the scheduler
      - ``job-activity.log`` - job data logged by the scheduler, rather than
        the job itself, such as output from the job submission command

      .. code-block:: sub

         <run-directory>/log/job/<cycle-point>/<task-name>/<job-submit-num>


   service directory
      The hidden service directory, under the workflow :term:`run directory`,
      stores information for internal use by Cylc. It is created at
      :term:`install` time.

      .. code-block:: sub

         <run-directory>/.service/


   contact file
      The contact file, in the :term:`service directory`, records information
      about a running scheduler such as host, TCP port, and process ID. It is
      read by Cylc client commands so they can target the right scheduler.

      The contact file is created at scheduler start and removed on clean
      shutdown. If you delete it, the scheduler will (after a delay) notice
      this and shut down.

      .. code-block:: sub

         <run-directory>/.service/contact

      .. warning::
         If the scheduler dies in an uncontrolled way, for example if the
         process is killed or the host goes down, the contact file may be
         left behind. Some Cylc commands automatically detect these files
         and remove them, otherwise they should be manually removed.


   job
      Jobs are real processes that perform :term:`tasks <task>` in a
      :term:`workflow`. In Cylc, they are implemented by :term:`job scripts
      <job script>` prepared by the :term:`scheduler`.


   job script
      A Cylc job script is a file containing bash code to implement a task
      definition in a workflow. It prepared and submitted to run by the
      :term:`scheduler` when the task is ready to run.

      Job scripts can be found in the task :term:`job log directory`.


   job host
      A job host is a compute resource that a :term:`job` runs on. For
      example ``node_1`` would be one of two possible job hosts on the
      :term:`platform` ``my_hpc`` for the task ``solver`` in the
      following workflow:

      .. code-block:: cylc
         :caption: global.cylc

         [platforms]
             [[my_hpc]]
                 hosts = node_1, node_2
                 job runner = slurm

      .. code-block:: cylc
         :caption: flow.cylc

         [runtime]
             [[solver]]
                 platform = my_hpc


   job submission number
      A single :term:`task` may run multiple :term:`jobs <job>` as a result of
      automatic :term:`retries <retry>` or manually retriggering.
      The job submission number is incremented each time, starting from 1.


   job runner
      A job runner is a system for submitting task :term:`jobs <job>` to run on
      a :term:`job platform <platform>`.

      Cylc supports various job runners, from direct background process
      execution to HPC batch queueing systems like PBS and Slurm (these are
      also known as *job schedulers* and *resource managers*).

      Job runners are configured on a per-platform basis in ``global.cylc``.

      .. seealso::

         * :cylc:conf:`global.cylc[platforms][<platform name>]job runner`.
         * :term:`directive`
         * `Wikipedia (job scheduler) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_scheduler>`_

      .. admonition:: Cylc 7
         :class: tip

         In Cylc 7 and earlier job runners were referred to as "batch systems".


   directive
      Directives request task :term:`jobs <job>` resources such as memory and
      node count from external :term:`job runners <job runner>`. They are job
      runner-specific.

      .. seealso::

         * :cylc:conf:`[runtime][<namespace>][directives]`


   platform
   job platform
      A platform for running Cylc task :term:`jobs <job>` is primarily defined
      by the combination of a :term:`job runner` and a group of :term:`hosts
      <job host>` that share a file system.

      For example ``my_hpc`` could be the platform for the task ``solver``
      in the following workflow:

      .. code-block:: cylc
         :caption: Global configuration (``global.cylc``)

         [platforms]
             [[my_hpc]]
                 hosts = node_1, node_2
                 job runner = slurm

      .. code-block:: cylc
         :caption: Workflow configuration (``flow.cylc``)

         [runtime]
             [[solver]]
                 platform = my_hpc

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`platform group`


   platform group
      A set of :term:`platforms <platform>` grouped under a common name.


   scheduler
      The Cylc scheduler is a program responsible for managing a single
      Cylc :term:`workflow`. It determines when each :term:`tasks <task>` is
      ready to run, submits its :term:`jobs <job>` to selected job runners,
      tracks job status, maintains the workflow state, and listens for queries
      and commands from the user.

      By default, Cylc schedulers run as daemons (and potentially on a remote
      host) so they won't be killed if you log out.

      .. seealso::

         * `Wikipedia: daemon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)>`_

      .. admonition:: Cylc 7
         :class: tip

         In Cylc 7 and earlier schedulers were known as "suite daemons".


   start
   startup
      This refers to starting a new instance of the Cylc :term:`scheduler`
      program to manage a particular :term:`workflow`. This can be from
      scratch, for installed workflows that haven't run previously, or to
      restart one that shut down prior to :term:`completion <workflow completion>`.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`cold start`
         * :term:`warm start`
         * :term:`start task`
         * :term:`restart`
         * :term:`reload`
         * :term:`shutdown`


   cold start
      A cold start is when the :term:`scheduler` :term:`start <startup>` a
      :term:`workflow` at the beginning of :term:`graph`. In a :term:`cycling
      workflow` this is determined by the :term:`initial cycle point`.

      This is the default behaviour of ``cylc play`` for an installed workflow
      that hasn't run yet.

      To satisfy unbounded :term:`intercycle dependence` in the graph, tasks
      prior to the initial cycle point are treated as if they have succeeded.

      .. seealso::

         * :cylc:conf:`[scheduling]initial cycle point`
         * :term:`warm start`
         * :term:`start task`
         * :term:`restart`
         * :term:`shutdown`


   warm start
      A warm start is when the :term:`scheduler` :term:`starts <start>` a
      :term:`cycling workflow` running from a :term:`start cycle point` after
      the :term:`initial cycle point`.

      To satisfy unbounded :term:`intercycle dependence` in the graph, tasks
      prior to the start cycle point are treated as if they have succeeded.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`cold start`
         * :term:`start task`
         * :term:`restart`
         * :term:`shutdown`


   start task
      A start task is :term:`task` in the :term:`graph` from which the
      :term:`scheduler` :term:`starts <start>` running a :term:`workflow` from
      scratch.

      Earlier tasks depended on by start tasks are treated as if they have
      succeeded.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`cold start`
         * :term:`warm start`
         * :term:`start cycle point`
         * :term:`shutdown`

      .. admonition:: Cylc 7
         :class: tip

         Cylc 7 and earlier did not have the capability to start from any task
         in the graph.


   cylc-run directory
      This refers to the top level directory for :term:`installed <workflow
      installation>` workflows: ``~/cylc-run``.

      Cylc can be configured to symlink cylc-run sub-directories to
      other locations.

      .. seealso::

         * :cylc:conf:`global.cylc[install][symlink dirs]`.
         * :term:`run directory`

      .. caution::

         The cylc-run directory should not be confused with specific
         :term:`workflow run directories <run directory>` below it.

   install
   installation
   workflow installation
      The ``cylc install`` command installs workflow :term:`source files
      <source directory>` into a new :term:`run directory` under the
      :term:`cylc-run directory`.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`reinstall`


   reinstall
   reinstallation
      The ``cylc reinstall`` command reinstalls workflow :term:`source files
      <source directory>` into an existing :term:`run directory` under the
      :term:`cylc-run directory`.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`install`


   source directory
   source workflow
      A source directory is any location where :term:`workflows <workflow>` are
      written and stored in preparation for installation with ``cylc install``
      or reinstallation with ``cylc reinstall``.

      These locations are configurable. The default is ``~/cylc-src``.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`run directory`
         * :cylc:conf:`global.cylc[install]source dirs`
         * :ref:`Installing-workflows`


   run directory
   workflow run directory
      This is a location under the :term:`cylc-run directory` that contains the
      :term:`installed <install>` configuration used to run a :term:`workflow`.

      At runtime, task :term:`jobs <job>` can get their workflow run
      directory from the environment variable ``CYLC_WORKFLOW_RUN_DIR``.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`source directory`
         * :term:`work directory`
         * :term:`share directory`
         * :term:`job log directory`


   play
      The ``cylc play`` command runs an instance of the :term:`scheduler`
      program to :term:`start` or :term:`restart` a :term:`workflow`.

      You can :term:`play`, :term:`pause` and :term:`stop` a :term:`workflow`,
      Cylc will always carry on where it left off.


   pause
      When a :term:`workflow` is "paused" the :term:`scheduler` is still
      running but it will not submit any new jobs.

      This can be useful if you want to make a change to a running workflow.

      Pause a workflow with ``cylc pause`` and resume it with ``cylc play``.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`play`
         * :term:`stop`
         * :term:`hold`


   stop
   shutdown
      A :term:`scheduler` can shut down on request, or automatically on
      :term:`workflow completion`. The :term:`workflow` is then stopped and no
      further :term:`jobs <job>` will be submitted.

      By default, the scheduler waits for any submitted or running task
      :term:`jobs <job>` to finish (either succeed or fail) before shutting
      down.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`play`
         * :term:`pause`
         * :term:`start`
         * :term:`restart`
         * :term:`reload`
         * :ref:`Cylc User Guide <Stopping Suites>`


   restart
      When a :term:`stopped <stop>` :term:`workflow` is :term:`played <play>`
      again, the :term:`scheduler` picks up where it left off rather than
      starting again from scratch. It also detects any orphaned :term:`jobs
      <job>` that changed state (e.g. succeeded) while the system was down.

      Changes made to the :term:`installed <install>` :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc`
      file will be picked at restart. We recommend that changes are
      :term:`reinstalled <reinstall>` from the workflow :term:`source
      directory` before restart, rather than made by editing the installed
      files directly.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`start`
         * :term:`stop`
         * :term:`reload`
         * :ref:`Cylc User Guide <Restarting Suites>`


   reload
      :term:`Schedulers <scheduler>` can reload their :term:`workflow`
      configuration from the :term:`installed <install>` :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc`
      file, to pick up changes made at runtime.

      We recommend that changes are :term:`reinstalled <reinstall>` from the
      workflow :term:`source directory` before reload, rather than made by
      editing the installed files directly.

      Any :term:`task` that is active at reload will continue with its
      pre-reload configuration. It's next instance (at the next cycle point)
      will adopt the new configuration.

      Reloading changes is safe providing they don't affect the
      :term:`workflow's <workflow>` :term:`graph`. Changes to the graph have
      certain caveats attached, see the `Cylc User Guide`_ for details.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`restart`


   hold
   held task
   hold after cycle point
      A :term:`task` held with ``cylc hold`` will not submit its :term:`jobs
      <job>` when ready to run.

      It is also possible to set a "hold after cycle point"; all tasks after
      this cycle point will be held.

      .. note::
         :term:`Workflows <workflow>` can be :term:`paused <pause>` with ``cylc
         pause``, and unpaused/resumed with ``cylc play``.

         :term:`Tasks <task>` can be :term:`held <hold>` with ``cylc hold`` and
         :term:`released <release>` with ``cylc release``.

         When a workflow is resumed, any held tasks remain held.


   release
      :term:`Held tasks <hold>` can be released with ``cylc release``,
      allowing submission of task :term:`jobs <job>` once again.

      It is also possible to remove the "hold after cycle point" if set,
      using ``cylc release --all``. This will also release all held tasks.


   task parameters
   parameterisation
      Task parameterisation is one way of consolidating configuration in the
      :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc` file. Cylc implicitly loops over ranges or lists
      of pre-defined parameters to automatically generate sets of similar
      tasks.

      Other ways of consolidating configuration include :term:`runtime
      inheritance` and templating with :ref:`Jinja2 <Jinja>` or :ref:`Empy
      <User Guide Empy>`.

      .. code-block:: cylc

         [scheduler]
             [[parameters]]
                 m = 1..3
         [scheduling]
             [[graph]]
                 R1 = bar<m> => baz<m>

      .. minicylc::
         :theme: none

         bar_m1 => baz_m1
         bar_m2 => baz_m2

         * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-cylc-parameterisation>`


   family
      In Cylc a family is a collection of :term:`tasks <task>` that share
      common configuration and which can be referred to collectively in the
      :term:`graph`.

      By convention families names are upper case, with the exception of the
      special ``root`` family that all tasks inherit from.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`family inheritance`
         * :term:`family trigger`
         * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-cylc-families>`


   runtime inheritance
   family inheritance
      A :term:`task` is a member of a :term:`family` if it inherits the
      family configuration via :cylc:conf:`[runtime][<namespace>]inherit`.

      For example the :term:`task` ``cheddar`` "belongs" to the :term:`family`
      ``CHEESE`` in the following snippet:

      .. code-block:: cylc

         [runtime]
             [[CHEESE]]
                 [[[environment]]]
                     COLOR = yellow
             [[cheddar]]
                 inherit = FAMILY

      Families can also inherit from other families. All tasks implicitly
      inherit from a special ``root`` family at the base of the inheritance
      hierarchy.

      Tasks can inherit from multiple families at once using a comma-separated
      list:

      .. code-block:: cylc

         inherit = foo, bar, baz

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`family trigger`
         * `Cylc User Guide`_


   family trigger
      :term:`Tasks <task>` that belong to a :term:`family` can be
      referred to collectively in the :term:`graph` using a family
      :term:`trigger`.
      
      Family triggers take the form ``FAMILY-NAME:qualifier``, where
      the :term:`qualifier` describes the collective state of member tasks
      needed for the dependency to be met. Some commonly used qualifiers
      are:

      ``succeed-all``
          All members succeeded.
      ``succeed-any``
          Any one member succeeded.
      ``fail-all``
          All members failed.
      ``finish-all``
          All members finished (succeeded or failed).

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`dependency`
         * :ref:`Cylc Tutorial <tutorial-cylc-family-triggers>`
         * `Cylc User Guide`_


   standard output
     Every :term:`task` has a set of standard :term:`outputs <task output>`
     that trigger :term:`task state` changes:

      - ``:submitted``, or ``:submit-failed``
      - ``:started``
      - ``:succeeded``, or ``:failed``


   task output
      Task outputs mark the progression of a :term:`task` from waiting (for
      prerequisites to be satisified) through to success or failure at run
      time. Downstream tasks can trigger off of the outputs of other tasks, as
      determined by the :term:`graph`.

      Outputs are written as ``task-name:OUTPUT`` in the :term:`graph`, and can
      be :term:`expected <expected output>` or :term:`optional <optional output>`.

      Tasks may have :term:`custom outputs <custom output>` as well as
      :term:`standard outputs <standard output>`.

      Here the task ``bar`` depends on the standard ``:started`` output of
      ``foo``:

      .. code-block:: cylc-graph

         foo:started => bar

      The standard ``:succeeded`` output is usually implicit:

      .. code-block:: cylc-graph

         foo => bar  # means foo:succeeded => bar


   dependence
   dependency
      Dependencies in the :term:`graph` show how :term:`tasks <task>` depend on
      some combination of the :term:`outputs <task output>` of other tasks.

      For example, in the following dependency the task ``baz`` depends on both
      ``foo`` and ``bar`` succeeding:

      .. code-block:: cylc-graph

         foo & bar => baz

      .. seealso::

          * :term:`task trigger`
          * :term:`conditional dependence`
          * :term:`intercycle dependence`


   conditional dependence
   conditional dependency
   conditional trigger
      Conditional :term:`dependence` is when a :term:`task` depends on multiple
      :term:`outputs <task output>` of other tasks combined with the ``&`` and
      ``|`` logical operators.

      .. code-block:: cylc-graph

         a & (b:fail | c) => d

      The left hand side of a conditional dependency can be called a
      conditional :term:`trigger`.


   trigger
      A trigger is the left-hand side of a :term:`dependency` in the
      :term:`graph`, i.e. the :term:`task outputs <task output>`
      that need to be completed before downstream tasks can run.

      In this example, the task ``bar`` can be said to trigger off of
      completion of the ``foo:started`` output:

      .. code-block:: cylc-graph

         foo:started => bar

      Triggers can be based on :term:`standard <standard output>` or
      :term:`custom <custom output>` task outputs. In the latter case they
      are known as :term:`message triggers <message trigger>`.


   message trigger
      A message trigger is a :term:`trigger` based on a
      :term:`custom task output <custom output>`. The task :term:`job` must
      send a user-defined message to the scheduler to complete the output.

      For brevity, the trigger in the :term:`graph` uses the output name, not
      the full message:

      .. code-block:: cylc

         [scheduling]
            [[graph]]
               R1 = """
                  foo:out1 => proc-out-1
                  foo:out2 => proc-out-2
         [runtime]
            [[foo]]
               [[[outputs]]]
                   # output name = output message
                   out1 = "Output 1 completed"
                   out2 = "Output 2 completed"

      However, if you don't need a descriptive message for the workflow
      log, you can make the message the same as its name:

   custom output
      A custom task output is a user-defined :term:`task output` that marks
      an event runtime event between task :term:`job` start and finish. To
      complete a custom output, the job must send a message defined in the
      :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc` file to the :term:`scheduler`.

      Triggers based on custom outputs are called :term:`message triggers
      <message trigger>`.

      .. code-block:: cylc

         [runtime]
            [[foo]]
               [[[outputs]]]
                   # output name = output message
                   out1 = "Output 1 completed"
                   out2 = "Output 2 completed"

         * `Cylc User Guide`_


   optional output
      Optional :term:`task outputs <task output>` are marked with a question
      mark in the :term:`graph`, e.g. ``foo:x?``, or ``foo:fail?``,  or
      ``foo?`` (short for ``foo:succeed?``). The may or may not be completed at
      runtime. Optional outputs are primarily used for :term:`graph branching`.

      .. seealso::

         * :term:`expected output`
         * `Cylc User Guide`_


   expected output
      Task outputs that are not marked as :term:`optional <optional output>`
      in the :term:`graph` are expected to be completed at runtime. If not, the
      :term:`scheduler` retains the task as :term:`incomplete <incomplete
      task>` pending user intervention.

      .. seealso::

         * :ref:`Cylc User Guide <expected outputs>`


   incomplete task
      Incomplete tasks are :term:`tasks <task>` that finish (succeed or fail)
      without completing all :term:`expected outputs <expected output>`. They
      are retained by the :term:`scheduler` in the :term:`n=0 window
      <n-window>` pending user intervention, and will cause a :term:`stall`
      if there are no more tasks to run.

   stall
   stalled workflow
   stalled state
      If there are no more tasks to run according to the :term:`graph`, but
      :term:`incomplete tasks <incomplete task>` are present, the
      :term:`scheduler` will stall and stay up for a time instead of
      shutting down with the workflow :term:`complete <workflow completion>`.

      Stalls are usually caused by unexpected task failures:

      .. digraph:: Example
         :align: center

         foo [style="filled" color="#ada5a5"]
         bar [style="filled" color="#ff0000" fontcolor="white"]
         baz [color="#88c6ff"]

         foo -> bar -> baz

      In this example the task ``bar`` has failed, so  that ``baz`` cannot
      run, but ``bar:fail`` was not marked as an :term:`optional output`.

      User intervention is required to fix a stall, e.g. by retriggering
      incomplete tasks after fixing the problems that caused them to fail.


   suicide trigger
      Suicide triggers remove :term:`tasks <task>` from the :term:`scheduler's
      <scheduler>` active (:term:`n=0 <n-window>`) window at runtime.

      They are denoted by exclamation marks, and are triggered like normal
      dependencies. For instance, the following suicide trigger will remove the
      task ``bar`` from the active window if ``foo`` succeeds:

      .. code-block:: cylc-graph

         foo => ! bar

      .. warning::
         Suicide triggers are not needed in Cylc 8 for :term:`graph branching`.
         They are retained for backward compatibility and rare edge cases.

      .. seealso::

         * :ref:`Cylc User Guide <SuicideTriggers>`

   branching
   graph branching
      Cylc handles workflow :term:`graphs <graph>` in an event-driven way:
      it can follow different graph paths depending on events at runtime. This
      is called *branching*.

      For example the following workflow follows one of two possible paths
      depending on the outcome of task ``b``:

      .. digraph:: example
         :align: center

         subgraph cluster_success {
            label = ":succeed"
            color = "green"
            fontcolor = "green"
            style = "dashed"

            c
         }

         subgraph cluster_failure {
            label = ":fail"
            color = "red"
            fontcolor = "red"
            style = "dashed"

            r
         }

         a -> b -> c -> d
         b -> r -> d

   flow number
      Flow number is an integer identifier for a particular :term:`flow`
      in a :term:`workflow` run.


   flow
   reflow
      A flow is a single logical run of a :term:`workflow` that follows the
      :term:`graph`, or part of the graph, onward from some start point.

      Cylc :term:`schedulers <scheduler>` can manage more than one flow in a
      single graph, at the same time. We call this capability *reflow*.
      The original flow in a new workflow run is :term:`started <startup>`
      with the ``cylc play`` command. Subsequent flows may be triggered from
      particular task(s) in the graph using ``cylc trigger --reflow``.

      Flows are identified by a :term:`flow number` that starts at ``1`` and
      increments for each triggered flow.

      Reflows are useful if you need to re-wind your :term:`workflow` to allow
      it to evolve a new path into the future, or to repeat-run some part of
      the graph to regenerate its outputs after making changes.

      For example, the following :term:`cycling workflow` runs a :term:`task`
      called ``model`` in every cycle, followed by a postprocessing task, two
      product generating tasks, and finally a task that publishes results for
      the cycle point:

         .. code-block:: cylc

            [scheduling]
                cycling mode = integer
                initial cycle point = 1
                [[graph]]
                    P1 = """
                        model [-P1] => model => post => prod1 & prod2 => publish
                    """

      Let's say the workflow has run to cycle 8, but we have just noticed that
      a corrupted ancillary file resulted in bad products at cycle 5.

      To rectify this we could fix the corrupted file and trigger a new flow
      (a reflow) from ``proc.5``::

         cylc trigger a.5 --reflow <workflow-id>

      The new flow will regenerate and republish the cycle 5 products before
      naturally coming to a halt because the the triggered tasks do not lead on
      to the next cycle and the rest of the graph.

      Meanwhile, the original flow will carry on unaffected, from cycle 8.

      If a task in one flow catches up to an active sibling from another flow
      (same name and :term:`cycle point`, different flow number) they will
      merge and carry both flow numbers forward. Downstream tasks can be
      considered to belong to both flows.

      Individual flows can be stopped with ``cylc stop --flow=<flow-number>``.
      This removes the target flow number from all active tasks. If a task has
      no flow numbers left it will not spawn downstream, thus stopping the flow.
     
      .. note::
         Currently you have to look at the :term:`scheduler log` to identify
         the flow numbers of particular tasks in the :term:`n=0 window <n-window>`.


   event
      An event is a milestone in the lifecycle of a :term:`workflow` or
      :term:`task` at which the :term:`scheduler` provides a hook for
      attaching :term:`event handlers <event handler>`.

      Workflow events include :term:`startup`, :term:`stall`, and
      :term:`shutdown`.

      Task events include :term:`task state` changes, to ``running`` or
      ``failed``, for example, or when the scheduler receivers CRITICAL or
      WARNING messages from a task :term:`job`.

   handler
   event handler
   event handlers
      An event handler is a user-defined executable that the
      :term:`scheduler` runs when selected :term:`task` or :term:`workflow`
      :term:`events <event>` occur.

      Use-cases include:

      - Send an email message.
      - Run a Cylc command.
      - Run *any* user-specified script or command.

   runahead limit
   runahead
      In a :term:`cycling workflow`, the runahead limit holds the fastest tasks
      back if they get too far ahead of the slowest ones. The default limit is
      5 cycles.

      .. seealso::

         * :cylc:conf:`[scheduling]runahead limit`

   workflow completion
      A workflow is deemed complete if there are no more tasks to run,
      according to the graph, and there are no :term:`incomplete task
      <incomplete task>` present.

      If the workflow is complete, the scheduler will automatically :term:`shut
      down <shutdown>`.

      If there are no more tasks to run, but there are incomplete tasks
      present, the scheduler will :term:`stall` rather than shut down.
