Cylc can manage infinite workflows of repeating tasks:

Cylc 8 has a new scheduling algorithm that:

- Is much more efficient because it only has to manage active tasks

  - waiting tasks are not pre-spawned before they are needed
  - succeeded tasks are not kept across the active task window
  - no costly indiscriminate dependency matching is done
- Distinguishes between :term:`optional <optional output>` and
  :term:`expected <expected output>` task outputs, to support:

  - :term:`graph branching` without :term:`suicide triggers <suicide trigger>`
  - correct diagnosis of :term:`workflow completion`
- Causes no implicit dependence on previous-instance job submit

  - instances of same task can run out of cycle point order
  - the workflow will not unnecessarily stall downstream of failed tasks
- Provides a sensible active-task based window on the evolving workflow

  - (to fully understand which tasks appeared in the Cylc 7 GUI you had to
    understand the scheduling algorithm)
- Supports multiple concurrent :term:`flows<flow>` within the same workflow.
- Can start a workflow from any task or tasks in the graph (no need for
  checkpoint restart)
- Can limit activity within as well as across cycles, without risking a stall
