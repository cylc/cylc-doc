Platforms
=========

.. note::

   The terms :term:`platform` and :term:`job platform` are equivalent.


.. admonition:: Does This Change Affect Me?
   :class: tip

   Platforms replace the following items in a Cylc 7 Workflow (suite):

   .. code-block:: cylc

      [runtime]
          [[task_name]]
              [[[job]]]
                  batch system = slurm
              [[[remote]]]
                  host = my_supercomputer

   Read this section if your workflow's jobs run on a remote computer or if
   you see the following warning on running ``cylc validate``:

   .. code-block:: console

      WARNING - Task <task>: deprecated "host" and "batch system" will be removed at Cylc 9

   If you currently use the ``rose host-select`` utility or a similar host
   selection or load balancing utility the intelligent host selection
   functionality of Cylc 8 may be used instead:

   .. code-block:: cylc

      [runtime]
          [[task_name]]
              [[[remote]]]
                  host = $(rose host-select my-computer)
          [[another_task]]
              # An example of a home-rolled host selector
              [[[remote]]]
                  host = $(test $((RANDOM%2)) -eq 0 && echo "host_a" || echo "host_b")


Overview
--------

Cylc 7 defines settings for remote :term:`jobs <job>` in each
:term:`task's <task>` definition.

Cylc 8 allows site administrators (and users) to configure
  :term:`platforms <platform>` in ``global.cylc``. A platform can have
  multiple hosts with associated platform-specific settings. Users only need to
  select the platform for their task jobs.

  Platforms also define how hosts are selected from each platform:

  - Randomly (default)
  - By definition order

There may be cases where sets of platforms (for example a group of
standalone compute servers, or a pair of mirrored HPC's) might be equally
suitable for a task, but not share files systems to allow them to constitute
a single platform. Such platforms can be set up to be ``platform groups``


.. seealso::

   :ref:`ListingAvailablePlatforms` for details of how to list platforms
   already defined.

   :ref:`AdminGuide.PlatformConfigs` for detailed examples of platform
   configurations.

.. warning::

   Cylc 8 contains upgrade logic which handles Cylc 7
   settings in most cases. Cylc 8 will warn you when it runs
   the upgrade logic. You should upgrade these parts of your
   workflows. Deprecated Cylc 7 settings will be removed at Cylc 9.


Examples
--------

.. seealso::

   :cylc:conf:`global.cylc[platforms]` has a detailed explanation of how
   platforms and platform groups are defined.

Showing how the global config changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This Cylc 7 workflow:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [runtime]
       [[mytask]]
           [[[job]]]
               batch system = slurm

           [[[remote]]]
               host = login_node01

Would, at Cylc 8, become:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [runtime]
       [[mytask]]
           platform = our_cluster

And the Cylc 8 global config might contain:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [platforms]
       [[our_cluster]]
           hosts = login_node01, login_node02
           job runner = slurm  # Cylc 8 replaced "batch system" with "job runner"


A variety of other examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are some example Cylc 7 task definitions:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [runtime]
      [[mytask_cylc_server]]

      [[mytask_big_server]]
         [[[remote]]]
            host = linuxbox42

      [[mytask_submit_local_to_remote_computer]]
         [[[job]]]
            batch system = pbs

      [[mytask_login_to_hpc_and_submit]]
         [[[remote]]]
            host = $(supercomputer_login_node_selector_script)
         [[[job]]]
            batch system = slurm


This will result in Cylc running:

- ``mytask_cylc_server`` on the machine the workflow is running on.
- ``mytask_big_server`` on ``linuxbox42``, using background.
- ``mytask_submit_local_to_remote_computer`` on a system where you can
  use PBS to submit from the workflow server.
- ``mytask_login_to_hpc_and_submit`` on a host set by the subshelled
  script using Slurm.

At Cylc 8 the equivalent might be:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [runtime]
       [[mytask_cylc_server]]

       [[mytask_big_server]]
           platform = linuxbox42

       [[mytask_submit_local_to_remote_computer]]
           platform = pbs_local

       [[mytask_login_to_hpc_and_submit]]
           # This is still legal, but you could also use host selection.
           platform = $(supercomputer_login_node_selector_script)

And the platform settings for these examples might be:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [platforms]
       [[linuxbox\d\d]]  # Regex to allow any linuxboxNN to use this definition
           # Without a hosts, platform name is used as a single host.

       [[pbs_local]]
           job runner = pbs
           hosts = localhost

       [[slurm_supercomputer]]
           hosts = login_node01, login_node02  # Cylc will pick a host.
           job runner = slurm
