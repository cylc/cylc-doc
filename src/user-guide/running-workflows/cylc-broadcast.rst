Cylc Broadcast
==============

Cylc "Broadcasts" allow us to override task's :cylc:conf:`[runtime]`
settings within a running workflow.

Broadcasts can target specific cycles, families or tasks.

Broadcasts can be helpful for:

* Quickly developing tasks without having to
  :ref:`edit and reload the workflow configuration <interventions.edit-the-workflow-configuration>`.
* Sending small amounts of data from a running task to other upcoming tasks (e.g. file paths).
* Reconfiguring production workflows while they are running.

Broadcasts which target specific cycles will eventually be
:ref:`expired <user_guide.broadcast.expiry>` when no longer needed.

Otherwise, broadcasts last for the life of the workflow and will persist if
the workflow is shutdown and restarted (unless manually "cleared").

Issuing Broadcasts
------------------

CLI
^^^

Some examples of issuing broadcasts using the ``cylc broacast`` CLI command:

.. code-block:: bash

   # set or update the environment variable "ANSWER" for all tasks
   cylc broadcast myworkflow -s '[environment]ANSWER=42'

   # amend the directives for all tasks in the cycle "2000"
   cylc broadcast myworkflow -p 2000 -s '[directives]--memory=2GB'

   # change the platform all tasks in the family "FOO" will submit on
   cylc broadcast myworkflow -n FOO -s 'platform=my-hpc'

The ``cylc broadcast`` command can be run from within tasks as a means to
communicate small amounts of data back to the scheduler for subsequent tasks to
use. Note that this will not work for remote task platforms which have been
configured to use polling -
:cylc:conf:`global.cylc[platforms][<platform name>]communication method = poll`.

For more information, run ``cylc broadcast --help``.


GUI
^^^

Broadcasts can also be issued from the GUI in a similar way by choosing
"Broadcast" from the task menu.

Additionally, the GUI provides a utility called "Edit Runtime" which loads
the tasks configuration into a form. Any changes you make are then broadcasted
to the task:

.. _user_guide.broadcast.expiry:

Expiry
------

Broadcasts which target specific cycles will eventually expire (i.e. be
deleted) as the workflow moves on, to avoid gradual accumulation
(note broadcasts are persisted when the workflow restarts).


Expiry Point
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Broadcasts expire once are they are no longer required by upcoming tasks.
The exact point at which a broadcast is expired depends on two things:

* The oldest cycle in the workflow to contain
  :term:`active tasks <active task>`.
* The longest cycling :term:`recurrence` in the workflow.

Broadcasts which are older than the oldest :term:`active cycle point`
*minus* the duration of the longest recurrence will be cleared.

For example, for the following workflow:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           P1Y = foo
           P2Y = bar
           P3Y = baz

The longest cycling recurrence is ``P3Y``.

If there were no more tasks left running in the cycle ``2000``, then broadcasts
for cycles earlier than ``1997`` (``2000 - P3Y``) would be expired.

This is designed to keep broadcasts as far back as the previous instance
of each task, in case you want to re-run it.


Broadcasting To Historical Cycles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Broadcasts targeting historical cycles may be expired as soon as they are
issued as the result of broadcast expiry.

However, broadcast expiry does not occur while the workflow is paused, so
you can pause the workflow, do the broadcast, trigger the tasks, and then
resume the workflow, e.g:

.. code-block:: bash

   cylc pause my-workflow
   cylc broadcast my-workflow -p 2000 -s ...
   cylc trigger my-workflow
   cylc play my-workflow


.. TODO: document sub-workflows
