.. _task-job-states:

Task and Job States
===================

**Tasks** are a workflow abstraction; they represent future and past jobs as
well as current active ones. Task states are represented by monochromatic icons
like |task-running|.

**Jobs** are less of an abstraction; they represent real job scripts submitted
to run as a process on a computer somewhere, or the final status of those
real processes. Job states are represented by colored icons like |job-running|.
Several color themes are provided.

A single task can have multiple jobs, by automatic retry or manual triggering.

.. _n-window:

Tasks Shown in the UIs
======================

Cylc graphs can be very large or even infinite in extent. The UI can't display
all the tasks at once, so it displays a :term:`window` or view of the workflow
centered on current active tasks and extending ``n`` graph edges out from them.

The ``n = 0`` or *active task* window includes:

- ``preparing`` tasks
- ``submitted`` and ``running`` tasks - i.e. those with active jobs
- ``waiting`` tasks, that are :term:`actively waiting <active waiting task>` on:
  
  - :ref:`clock triggers <Built-in Clock Triggers>`
  - :ref:`external triggers <Section External Triggers>`
  - :ref:`internal queues <InternalQueues>`
  - :ref:`runahead limit <RunaheadLimit>`
 
- finished tasks retained as *incomplete*, in expectation of user intervention:

  - ``submit-failed`` tasks, if successful submission was not :term:`optional <optional output>`
  - ``succeeded`` or ``failed`` tasks that did not complete :term:`expected
    outputs <expected output>`

The default window extent is ``n = 1``, i.e. tasks out to one graph edge from
current active tasks.

Tasks ahead of the ``n=0`` window are displayed by the UI as ``waiting`` but
the scheduler is not actively managing them yet.

Retrying Tasks
==============

Tasks that fail but are configured to :term:`retry` return to the ``waiting``
state, with a new clock trigger to handle the configured retry delay.

.. note::

   A task that is waiting on a retry will already have one or more failed jobs
   associated with it.
