Auto Stop-Restart
-----------------

Cylc has the ability to automatically stop workflows running on a particular host
and optionally, restart them on a different host.
This is useful if a host needs to be taken off-line e.g. for
scheduled maintenance.

See :py:mod:`cylc.flow.main_loop.auto_restart` for details.
