Concurrent Flows
================

.. versionadded:: 8.0.0

In Cylc, a *flow* is a self-propagating run through the workflow :term:`graph`
from some initial task(s).

At start-up the :term:`scheduler` automatically launches a flow from the start
of the graph. But you can use ``cylc trigger --flow=new ID`` to start additional 
flows anywhere in the graph, while the original (and any other) flow still
runs. New flows continue on from triggered tasks as dictated by the graph.

When a flow advances to a new task in the :term:`graph`, the task will only run
if it did not already run in the same flow.

See :ref:`below<flow-trigger-use-cases>` for suggested use cases, and an
:ref:`example<new-flow-example>`, of this capability.

.. note::
   Flows :ref:`merge<flow-merging>` where (and if) tasks collide in the ``n=0``
   :term:`active window`. Downstream of a merge, tasks are considered to belong
   to all constituent flows.


Flow Numbers
------------

Flows are identified by numbers passed down from parent task to child task in
the graph.

Flow number ``1`` is triggered automatically by ``cylc play`` at :term:`scheduler`
start-up. The next flow started by :ref:`manual triggering<triggering-flows>`
gets the number ``2``, then ``3``, and so on.

Tasks can carry multiple flow numbers as a result of :ref:`flow
merging<flow-merging>`.

.. note::
   Flow numbers are not yet exposed in the UI, but they are logged with task
   events in the :term:`scheduler log`.


.. _triggering-flows:

Triggering & Flows
------------------

By default, manual triggering (with ``cylc trigger`` or the UI) starts a new
:term:`front of activity<flow front>` in current flows.
But it can also start new flows and trigger flow-independent single tasks.

In the diagrams below, the grey tasks run in the original flow (``1``), and the
blue ones run as a result of a manual triggering event. They may be triggered
as part of flow ``1``, or as a new flow ``2``, or with no flow number.

Triggering in Current Flows
   ``cylc trigger [--wait] ID``

   This is the default action. The triggered task gets all current active flow
   numbers. Subsequently, each of those flows will consider the task to have
   run already.

   **Ahead of active flows** this starts a new front of activity for the
   existing flows, which by default can continue on without waiting for them to
   catch up:

   .. image:: ../../img/same-flow-n.png

   With ``--wait``, action downstream of the triggered task is delayed until
   the first flow catches up:

   .. image:: ../../img/same-flow-wait-n.png

   **Behind active flows** the triggered task will run, but nothing more will
   happen if any of the original flows already passed by there:

   .. image:: ../../img/same-flow-behind.png

Triggering in Specific Flows
   ``cylc trigger --flow=1,2 ID``

   This triggers the task with flow numbers ``1`` and ``2``.

   The result is like the default above, except that tasks in the new front
   belong only to the specified flow(s), regardless of which flows are
   :term:`active` at triggering time.

Triggering a New Flow
   ``cylc trigger --flow=new ID``

   This triggers the task with a new, incremented flow number.

   The new flow will re-run tasks that already ran in previous flows:

   .. image:: ../../img/new-flow-n.png


Triggering a Flow-Independent Single Task
   ``cylc trigger --flow=none ID``

   This triggers a task with no flow numbers.

   It will not spawn children, and other flows that come by will re-run it.

   .. image:: ../../img/no-flow-n.png

Special Case: Triggering ``n=0`` Tasks
   Tasks in the ``n=0`` window are :term:`active`, :term:`active-waiting`, or
   :term:`incomplete`. Their flow membership is already determined - that of
   the parent tasks that spawned them.

   - Triggering an :term:`active task` has no effect (it is already triggered).
   - Triggering an :term:`active-waiting task` queues it to run in the same flow.
   - Triggering an :term:`incomplete task` queues it to re-run in the same flow.


.. _flow-merging:

Flow Merging in ``n=0``
-----------------------

If a task spawning into the ``n=0`` :term:`window` finds another instance
of itself already there (i.e., same name and cycle point, different flow
number) a single instance will carry both (sets of) flow numbers forward from
that point. Downstream tasks belong to both flows.

Flow merging in ``n=0`` means flows are not completely independent. One flow
might not be able to entirely overtake another because one or more of its tasks
might merge in ``n=0``. Merging is necessary while task IDs - and associated
log directory paths etc. - do not incorporate flow numbers, because task IDs
must be unique in the :term:`active task pool`.

Merging with Incomplete tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:term:`Incomplete<incomplete>` tasks are retained in the active window in
expectation of retriggering to complete :term:`expected outputs<expected
output>` and continue their flow.

If another flow encounters an incomplete task (i.e. if another instance of the
same task collides with it in the ``n=0`` :term:`active window`) the task will
run again and carry both flow numbers forward if it successfully completes its
expected outputs.


Stopping Flows
--------------

By default, ``cylc stop`` halts the workflow and shuts the scheduler down.

It can also stop specific flows: ``cylc stop --flow=N`` removes the flow number
``N`` from tasks in the :term:`active task pool`. Tasks that have no flow
numbers left as a result do not spawn children at all. If there are no active
flows left, the scheduler shuts down.

.. _flow-trigger-use-cases:

Some Use Cases
--------------

Running Tasks Ahead of Time
   To run a task within the existing flow(s) even though its prerequisites are
   not yet satisfied, just trigger it. Use ``--wait`` if you don't want the new
   flow front to continue immediately. Triggered task(s) will not re-run when
   the main front catches up.

Regenerating Outputs Behind a Flow
   To re-run a sub-graph (e.g. because the original run was affected by a
   corrupt file), just trigger the task(s) at the top of the sub-graph with
   ``--flow=new``.

   You may need to manually stop the new flow if it leads into the main trunk
   of the graph, and you do not want it to carry on indefinitely.

Rewinding a Workflow
   To rewind the workflow to an earlier point, perhaps to regenerate data and/or 
   allow the workflow to evolve a new path into the future, trigger a new
   flow at the right place and then stop the original flow.

Test-running Tasks in a Live Workflow
   You can trigger individual tasks as many times as you like with
   ``--flow=none``, without affecting the workflow. The task :term:`submit
   number` will increment each time.

Processing Flow-Specific Data?
   :term:`Flow numbers<flow number>` are passed to job environments, so it is
   possible for tasks to process flow-specific data. Every task would have to
   be capable of processing multiple datasets at once, however, in case of
   :term:`flow merging<flow merge>`. Generally, you should use :term:`cycling`
   for this kind of use case.

.. _new-flow-example:

Example: Rerun a Sub-Graph
---------------------------

The following :term:`cycling workflow` runs a :term:`task` called ``model`` in
every cycle, followed by a postprocessing task, two product-generating tasks,
and finally a task that publishes results for the cycle point:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       cycling mode = integer
       initial cycle point = 1
       [[graph]]
           P1 = model[-P1] => model => post => prod1 & prod2 => publish

Let's say the workflow has run to cycle 8, but we have just noticed that
a corrupted ancillary file resulted in bad products at cycle 5.

To rectify this we could fix the corrupted file and trigger a new flow at
``5/post``:

.. code-block:: cylc

   cylc trigger --flow=new <workflow_id>//5/post

The new flow will regenerate and republish cycle 5 products before naturally
coming to a halt, because the triggered tasks do not feed into the next cycle.

Meanwhile, the original flow will carry on unaffected, from cycle point 8.
