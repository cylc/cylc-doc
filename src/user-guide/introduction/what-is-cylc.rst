What is Cylc?
=============

Cylc (pronounced silk) is a workflow engine, a system that automatically
executes tasks according to schedules and dependencies.

In a Cylc workflow each step is an application: an excecutable command, script,
or program. Cylc runs each task as soon as it is appropriate to do so.
