Scheduling Configuration
========================

.. tutorial:: Scheduling Tutorial <tutorial-scheduling>

The :cylc:conf:`[scheduling]` section of the :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc` file
defines what tasks exist in the workflow, in a :term:`dependency graph <graph>`,
and when they should run, relative to each other and to constraints such as
:term:`clock triggers <clock trigger>`, :term:`external triggers <external
trigger>`, and :term:`internal queues <internal queue>`


The Graph
---------

.. tutorial:: Graph Tutorial <tutorial-cylc-graphing>

The :term:`graph` defines a workflow in terms of its :term:`tasks <task>` and
the :term:`dependencies <dependency>` between them.

A Cylc :term:`graph` is composed of one or more :term:`graph strings <graph
string>` which use a special syntax to define the dependencies between tasks:

* arrow symbols ``=>`` declare dependencies
* logical operators ``&`` (AND) and ``|`` (OR) can be used to write
  :term:`conditional dependencies <conditional dependency>`.

For example:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   # baz will not be run until both foo and bar have succeeded
   foo & bar => baz

Graph strings are configured under the :cylc:conf:`[scheduling][graph]` section
of the :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc` file:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           R1 = """
               foo & bar => baz
           """

In this example ``R1`` is a :term:`recurrence expression <recurrence>` that
defines how often, and on what cycle interval, to run this part of the graph.
For example, ``R1`` means run once, and ``P1D`` means run repeatedly on a 1-day
cycle.

Graph strings may contain blank lines, arbitrary white space and comments e.g:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           R1 = """
               foo & bar => baz  # baz depends on foo and bar

           """

Graphs can be broken down into pairs of :term:`triggers <trigger>`, where the
left side is a single task output, or a logical expression involving several of
them, and the right side is the task or family that triggers when the output
(or expression) is completed.

In the case of cycling tasks, triggers are valid for cycle points matching the
recurrence expression for the graph string. For example this graph:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           T00,T12 = "A => B"

implies that ``B`` triggers off of ``A`` (i.e. off of the ``A:succeeded`` output)
for cycle points where the hour matches ``00`` or ``12``. To define intercycle
dependencies, attach an offset indicator to the left side of a pair:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           T00,T12 = "A[-PT12H] => B"

This means task ``B`` triggers off of task ``A[-PT12H]`` (12 hours before, with
respect to cycle point) at every point with hours matching ``00`` and ``12`` in
a sequence starting at the initial cycle point.
Note: current cycle point is implicit - only offsets need to be specified -
because most tasks depend only on others with the same cycle point.

Cycle point offsets can only appear on the left side of an arrow. However,
``A => B[-PT6H]``, which is illegal, can be reformulated as a :term:`future
trigger` ``A[+PT6H] => B`` (see :ref:`InterCyclePointTriggers`). It is also
possible to combine multiple offsets within a cycle point offset e.g.

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           T00,T12 = "A[-P1D-PT12H] => B"

This means that ``B`` triggers off ``A[-P1D-PT12H]`` (1 day and 12 hours before)
at each cycle point.

Triggers can be chained together. This graph:

.. code-block:: cylc

   T00, T12 = """
       A => B  # B triggers off A
       B => C  # C triggers off B
   """

is equivalent to this:

.. code-block:: cylc

   T00, T12 = "A => B => C"

All triggers defined for the same task combine, so this:

.. code-block:: cylc

   T00, T12 = """
       A => X  # X triggers off A
       B => X  # X also triggers off B
   """

is equivalent to this:

.. code-block:: cylc

   T00, T12 = "A & B => X"  # X triggers off A AND B

In summary, the branching tree structure of a dependency graph can
be partitioned into lines (in the :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc` graph string) of
dependency pairs or chains, in any way you like. Use white space and comments
to make the graph as clear as possible.

.. code-block:: cylc

   # B triggers if A succeeds, then C and D trigger if B succeeds:
   R1 = "A => B => C & D"

   # which is equivalent to this:
   R1 = """
       A => B => C
       B => D
   """

   # and to this:
   R1 = """
       A => B => D
       B => C
   """

   # and to this:
   R1 = """
       A => B
       B => C
       B => D
   """

   # and it can even be written like this:
   R1 = """
       A => B # blank line follows:

       B => C # comment ...
       B => D
   """

Splitting Up Long Graph Lines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is not necessary to use the fragile line continuation marker ``\`` to split
long graph lines. You can break at dependency arrows (``=>``) and operators
(``&``, ``|``), or split long chains into smaller ones. This graph:

.. code-block:: cylc

   R1 = "A & B => C"

is equivalent to this:

.. code-block:: cylc

   R1 = """
       A & B =>
       C
   """

and also to this:

.. code-block:: cylc

   R1 = """
       A &
       B => C
   """

.. note::

   Multiple graph strings add together to make the complete workflow graph.


.. versionchanged:: 8.0.0

   Graph strings can be broken on ``&`` and ``|`` as well as ``=>``.


.. _GraphTypes:

Graph Types

Non-Cycling
^^^^^^^^^^^

The following is a small workflow of non-cycling tasks; these all have a
single cycle point (``1``), and once they're all finished the scheduler
shuts down.

.. Need to use a 'container' directive to get centered image with
   left-aligned caption (as required for code block text).

.. container:: twocol

   .. container:: caption

      .. code-block:: cylc

         [scheduling]
             [[graph]]
                 R1 = "foo => bar & baz => qux"

   .. container:: image

      .. _fig-test1:

      .. figure:: ../../img/test1.png
         :align: center

Cycling Graphs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For cycling tasks we give a *recurrence expression* that defines a sequence of
cycle points for which the graph string is valid, as demonstrated here for a
small workflow of cycling tasks:

.. Need to use a 'container' directive to get centered image with
   left-aligned caption (as required for code block text).

.. container:: twocol

   .. container:: caption

      .. code-block:: cylc

         [scheduling]
             [[graph]]
                # (note no dependence between cycle points)
                 T00,T12 = "foo => bar & baz => qux"

   .. container:: image

      .. _fig-test2:

      .. figure:: ../../img/test2.png
         :align: center


.. tutorial:: Datetime Tutorial <tutorial-datetime-cycling>

For example in the following scenario:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           T06 = foo => bar

``T06`` means "Run every day starting at 06:00 after the
initial cycle point". Cylc allows you to start (or end) at any particular
time, repeat at whatever frequency you like, and even optionally limit the
number of repetitions.

.. _writing_flows.scheduling.syntax_rules:

Cycling Syntax Rules
--------------------

:term:`Datetime cycling <datetime cycling>` information is made up of:

* a :term:`datetime <ISO 8601 datetime>` that typically specifies the start
  point of the sequence
* an interval between points in the sequence
* and an optional limit on the number of points in the sequence

The time is assumed to be in UTC unless you set
:cylc:conf:`[scheduler]cycle point time zone`.

.. attention::

   .. versionchanged:: 8.0.0

   At Cylc 7 the time zone was assumed to be local time unless
   :cylc:conf:`[scheduler]cycle point time zone` or :cylc:conf:`[scheduler]UTC mode`
   was set. If your workflow is running in
   :ref:`Cylc 7 compatibility mode <cylc_7_compat_mode>`
   this remains the case.

The calendar is assumed to be the proleptic Gregorian calendar unless
you set :cylc:conf:`[scheduling]cycling mode`.

The syntax is based on the :term:`ISO 8601` datetime standard, which includes
the representation of datetimes and intervals. Cylc (optionally) allows these
representations to be heavily condensed by omitting information that can be
inferred from context (rules below).

.. important::

   Cycle points in Cylc are just task labels that anchor dependence on
   other tasks, and which task jobs can use to determine their current cycle
   point. **Datetime cycle points have no relation to wallclock (real) time**
   except where specific tasks, if any, depend on :term:`clock triggers <clock
   trigger>`.

There are three ISO 8601 recurrence formats supported by Cylc, detailed below
in order from most commonly used to least commonly used.


Format 3: ``R[limit?]/[datetime]/[interval]``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most common full form for recurrences is
``R[limit?]/[datetime]/[interval]``. This is format number 3 in the ISO 8601
standard. The datetime specifies the start of the cycling sequence.
For example, ``R3/2000-01-01T00Z/P2D`` means "run 3 times, every 2 days,
starting at 2000-01-01T00Z (midnight, Jan 1st 2000)"; the list of points
on this sequence is:

.. code-block:: none

   2000-01-01T00Z
   2000-01-03T00Z
   2000-01-05T00Z

In Cylc, this form can be condensed to:

.. code-block:: sub

   R[limit?]/[datetime]
   R[limit?]//[interval]
   [datetime]/[interval]
   R[limit?] # Special limit of 1 case
   [datetime]
   [interval]

Here are some examples for each form:

.. code-block:: sub

   R5/T00            # Run 5 times at 00:00 every day
   R//PT1H           # Run every hour (Note the R// is optional)
   20000101T06Z/P1D  # Run every day starting at 06:00 1st Jan 2000
   R1                # Run once at the initial cycle point
   R1/20000101T00Z   # Run once at 00:00 1st Jan 2000
   P1Y               # Run every year

.. note::

   ``T00`` is an example of ``[datetime]``, with an
   inferred 1 day period and no limit (it is short for ``R/T00``).

Where some or all datetime information is omitted, it is inferred to
be relative to the :term:`initial cycle point`. For example, ``T00``
by itself would mean the next occurrence of midnight that follows, or is, the
initial cycle point. ``+PT6H`` means 6 hours after the initial cycle point.
``-P1D`` means 1 day before the initial cycle point. The default is the initial
cycle point itself.

If the interval is omitted and some (but not all) datetime information is
omitted, it is inferred to be a single unit above the largest given specific
datetime unit. For example, the largest given specific unit in ``T00`` is
hours, so the inferred interval is 1 day (daily), ``P1D``.

If the limit is omitted, unlimited cycling is assumed. This will be
bounded by the workflow's final cycle point if given.


Format 4: ``R[limit?]/[interval]/[datetime]``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another supported recurrence form is:
``R[limit?]/[interval]/[datetime]`` (format number 4 in the ISO 8601 standard).
This uses the datetime as the end of the cycling sequence rather than the start.
For example, ``R3/P5D/2014-04-30T06`` means "run 3 times, every 5 days, ending
at 2014-04-30T06 (06:00, April 30th 2014)"; the list of points on this
sequence is:

.. code-block:: none

   2014-04-20T06
   2014-04-25T06
   2014-04-30T06

This form can be used to get special behaviour relative to
the final cycle point.

We can also represent this in Cylc with a collapsed form:

.. code-block:: none

   R[limit?]/[interval]
   R[limit?]//[datetime]
   [interval]/[datetime]

So, for example, you can write:

.. code-block:: sub

   R1//+P0D  # Run once at the final cycle point
   R5/P2D    # Run 5 times, every 2 days, ending at the final cycle point
   P2W/T00   # Run every 2 weeks ending at 00:00 before/at the final cycle point
   R//T00    # Run every day ending at 00:00 before/at the final cycle point


Format 1: ``R[limit?]/[datetime]/[datetime]``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A less common recurrence form is ``R[limit?]/[datetime]/[datetime]``
(format number 1 in the ISO 8601 standard). This uses the difference between
the first datetime and the second datetime to set the recurrence interval.
The first datetime is the start point. For example,
``R3/2020-07-10/2020-07-15`` means "run 3 times, every 5 days, starting at
2020-07-10 (midnight, July 10th 2020)"; the list of points on this sequence is:

.. code-block:: none

   2020-07-10
   2020-07-15
   2020-07-20

.. caution::

   Cylc will always calculate the interval in
   :term:`exact datetime units <exact datetime unit>`. So for the example
   of ``R/2004/2005``, the interval will be ``P366D`` (2004 is a leap year)
   rather then ``P1Y``, because year is an
   :term:`inexact unit <inexact datetime unit>`.

.. note::

   In versions of Cylc prior to 8.0.0, this syntax was undocumented and
   behaved differently, in a way which was not in accordance with the
   :term:`ISO 8601` standard.


.. _referencing-the-initial-and-final-cycle-points:

Referencing The Initial And Final Cycle Points
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The caret and dollar symbols are shorthand for the initial and final cycle
points:

.. code-block:: sub

   R1/^+PT12H  # Repeat once 12 hours after the initial cycle point
               # R[limit]/[datetime]
               # Equivalent to R1/+PT12H
   R1/$        # Repeat once at the final cycle point
               # R[limit]/[datetime]
               # Equivalent to R1//+P0D
   $-P2D/PT3H  # Repeat 3 hourly starting two days before the
               # [datetime]/[interval]
               # final cycle point

.. note::

   There are multiple ways to write the same recurrences, for instance
   the following all run once at the final cycle point:

   .. code-block:: sub

      R1/P0Y       # R[limit]/[interval]
      R1/P0Y/$     # R[limit]/[interval]/[datetime]
      R1/$         # R[limit]/[datetime]

.. _excluding-dates:


The Initial Cycle Point
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A workflow normally begins running at the :term:`initial cycle point`, which defines
the start of the workflow graph:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       initial cycle point = 20100808T06Z

This can be overridden on the command line:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cylc play foo --initial-cycle-point=20120808T06Z


.. _setting-the-icp-relative-to-now:

Setting The Initial Cycle Point Relative To The Current Time
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. warning::

   Setting the initial cycle point relative to the current time only works
   for :term:`datetime cycling` workflows using the Gregorian calendar.
   It does not work for alternative calendars like the 360, 365 or 366 day
   calendars, or integer cycling.

The ``next`` and ``previous`` syntax can be used with truncated ISO 8601
representations, to set the initial cycle point:
``next(Thh:mmZ)``, ``previous(T-mm)``; e.g.

* ``initial cycle point = next(T15:00Z)``
* ``initial cycle point = previous(T09:00)``
* ``initial cycle point = next(T12)``
* ``initial cycle point = previous(T-20)``

A list of times, separated by semicolons, can be provided, e.g.
``next(T-00;T-15;T-30;T-45)``. At least one time is required within the
brackets, and if more than one is given, the major time unit in each (hours
or minutes) should be of the same type.

If an offset from the specified datetime is required, this should be
of the form ``previous(Thh:mm) +/- PxTy`` as is used
for determining cycle periods, e.g.

* ``initial cycle point = previous(T06) +P1D``
* ``initial cycle point = next(T-30) -PT1H``

The next/previous syntax is interpreted first, then the offset is applied.

Offsets used without ``next`` or ``previous`` are interpreted as offsets from "now".

Relative initial cycle points also work with truncated dates, including
weeks and ordinal date, using ISO 8601 truncated date representations.
Note that day-of-week should always be specified when using weeks. If a time
is not included, the calculation of the next or previous corresponding
point will be done from midnight of the current day.

The Environment Variable CYLC\_WORKFLOW\_INITIAL\_CYCLE\_POINT
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

At start up the initial cycle point is passed to task job environments
as ``$CYLC_WORKFLOW_INITIAL_CYCLE_POINT`` and stored in the workflow
database to persist across restarts. However it gets wiped out (set to
``None``) by a :term:`warm start` (``cylc play --start-cycle-point`` or ``cylc
play --start-task``) - which is essentially a restart that ignores prior state
information.

The ``$CYLC_WORKFLOW_INITIAL_CYCLE_POINT`` variable allows tasks to
check if they are running in the initial cycle point, when different behaviour
may be required. Note however that an initial ``R1`` graph section is the
preferred way to get different behaviour at workflow start-up.


.. _HowMultipleGraphStringsCombine:


How Multiple Graph Strings Combine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multiple graph strings add together to make the complete workflow graph.
Recurrences can overlap, and tasks can appear in multiple graph strings. It is
OK (but unnecessary) to define duplicate dependencies.

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           T00,T06,T12,T18 = "A => B => C"
           T06,T18 = "B => C => X"
           # duplicate prerequisite: B => C already defined at T06, T18

This graph can be written more concisely, with the same result, like this:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           T00,T06,T12,T18 = "A => B => C"
           # X triggers off C only at 6 and 18 hours
           T06,T18 = "C => X"


Excluding Dates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:term:`datetimes <ISO 8601 datetime>` can be excluded from a :term:`recurrence`
by an exclamation mark for example ``PT1D!20000101`` means run daily except on
the first of January 2000.

This syntax can be used to exclude multiple datetimes from a recurrence, using
the syntax ``PT1D!(20000101,20000102,...)``. All datetimes listed within
the parentheses will be excluded.

.. note::

   The ``^`` and ``$`` symbols (shorthand for the initial
   and final cycle points) are both datetimes so ``T12!$-PT1D``
   is valid.

If using a run limit in combination with an exclusion, the recurrence might not
run the expected number of times. For example, in the following
workflow ``foo`` will only run once as its second run is excluded.

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       initial cycle point = 20000101T00Z
       final cycle point = 20000105T00Z
       [[graph]]
           R2/P1D!20000102 = foo

Excluding Recurrences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Exclusions may themselves be datetime recurrence sequences. Any partial
datetime or sequence after the exclamation mark will be excluded from the main
sequence.

For example, partial datetimes can be excluded like this:

.. code-block:: sub

   PT1H ! T12                   # Run hourly but not at 12:00 from the initial
                                # cycle point.
   T-00 ! (T00, T06, T12, T18)  # Run hourly but not at 00:00, 06:00,
                                # 12:00, 18:00.
   PT5M ! T-15                  # Run 5-minutely but not at 15 minutes past the
                                # hour from the initial cycle point.
   T00 ! W-1T00                 # Run daily at 00:00 except on Mondays.

And sequences can be excluded like this:

.. code-block:: sub

   PT1H ! PT6H         # Run hourly from the initial cycle point but
                       # not 6-hourly from the initial cycle point.
   T-00 ! PT6H         # Run hourly on the hour but not 6-hourly on the hour.
   # Same as T-00 ! T-00/PT6H (T-00 context is implied)
   # Same as T-00 ! (T00, T06, T12, T18)
   # Same as PT1H ! (T00, T06, T12, T18) Initial cycle point dependent

   T12 ! T12/P15D      # Run daily at 12:00 except every 15th day.

   R/^/P1H ! R5/20000101T00/P1D    # Any valid recurrence may be used to
                                   # determine exclusions. This example
                                   # means: Repeat every hour from
                                   # the initial cycle point, but exclude
                                   # 00:00 for 5 days from 1 January 2000.

You can combine exclusion sequences and single point exclusions like this:

.. code-block:: sub

   T-00 ! (20000101T07, PT2H)  # Run hourly on the hour but not at 07:00
                               # on the 1st Jan, 2000 and not 2-hourly
                               # on the hour.

Advanced Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are several examples of Cylc graph recurrence expressions:

.. code-block:: sub

   R1         # Run once at the initial cycle point
   P1D        # Run every day starting at the initial cycle point
   PT5M       # Run every 5 minutes starting at the initial cycle point
   T00/P2W    # Run every 2 weeks starting at 00:00 after the

   R1/P0Y     # Run once at the final cycle point
   R1/$       # Run once at the final cycle point (alternative form)
   R1/$-P3D   # Run once three days before the final cycle point
   R3/T0830   # Run 3 times, every day at 08:30 after the initial cycle point
   R3/01T00   # Run 3 times, every month at 00:00 on the first
              # of the month after the initial cycle point
   R5/W-1/P1M # Run 5 times, every month starting on Monday
              # following the initial cycle point
   T00!^      # Run at the first occurrence of T00 that isn't the
              # initial cycle point
   PT1D!20000101  # Run every day days excluding 1st Jan 2000
   20140201T06/P1D    # Run every day starting at 20140201T06
   R1/min(T00,T06,T12,T18)  # Run once at the first instance
                            # of either T00, T06, T12 or T18
                            # starting at the initial cycle point

.. _AdvancedStartingUp:

Advanced Starting Up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dependencies that are only valid at the :term:`initial cycle point` can be
written using an ``R1`` recurrence. For example:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       initial cycle point = 20130808T00
       final cycle point = 20130812T00
       [[graph]]
           R1 = "prep => foo"
           T00 = "foo[-P1D] => foo => bar"

In the example above, ``R1`` implies ``R1/20130808T00``, so
``prep`` only runs once at that cycle point (the initial cycle point).
``foo`` will depend on ``prep`` there, but not at subsequent cycle points.

However, it is possible to have a workflow that has multiple effective initial
cycles - for example, one starting at ``T00`` and another starting
at ``T12``. What if they need to share an initial task?

Let's suppose that we add the following section to the workflow example above:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       initial cycle point = 20130808T00
       final cycle point = 20130812T00
       [[graph]]
           R1 = "prep => foo"
           T00 = "foo[-P1D] => foo => bar"
           T12 = "baz[-P1D] => baz => qux"

We'll also say that there should be a starting dependence between
``prep`` and our new task ``baz`` - but we still want to have
a single ``prep`` task, at a single cycle.

We can write this using a special case of the ``task[-interval]`` syntax -
if the interval is null, this implies the task at the initial cycle point.

For example, we can write our workflow like so, to produce the graph as shown:

.. Need to use a 'container' directive to get centered image with
   left-aligned caption (as required for code block text).

.. container:: twocol

   .. container:: caption

      *Staggered Start Workflow*

      .. code-block:: cylc

         [scheduling]
             initial cycle point = 20130808T00
             final cycle point = 20130812T00
             [[graph]]
                 R1 = "prep"
                 # ^ implies the initial cycle point:
                 R1/T00 = "prep[^] => foo"
                 # ^ is initial cycle point, as above:
                 R1/T12 = "prep[^] => baz"
                 T00 = "foo[-P1D] => foo => bar"
                 T12 = "baz[-P1D] => baz => qux"

   .. container:: image

      .. _fig-test4:

      .. figure:: ../../img/test4.png
         :align: center


Usually, we want to specify additional tasks and dependencies at the initial
cycle point. But what if we want our first cycle point to be entirely special,
with some tasks missing compared to subsequent cycle points?

In the workflow below, ``bar`` will not run at the initial cycle point, but
will still run at subsequent cycle points. ``+PT6H/PT6H`` means start at
``+PT6H`` (6 hours after the initial cycle point) and then repeat every
``PT6H`` (6 hours):

.. Need to use a 'container' directive to get centered image with
   left-aligned caption (as required for code block text).

.. container:: twocol

   .. container:: caption

      *Restricted First Cycle Point Workflow*

      .. code-block:: cylc

          [scheduling]
              initial cycle point = 20130808T00
              final cycle point = 20130808T18
              [[graph]]
                  R1 = "setup_foo => foo"
                  +PT6H/PT6H = """
                      foo[-PT6H] => foo
                      foo => bar
                  """

   .. container:: image

      .. _fig-test5:

      .. figure:: ../../img/test5.png
         :align: center


Some workflows may have staggered start-up sequences where different tasks need
to run once but only at specific cycle points, e.g. because of differing
data sources at different cycle points, with different possible initial cycle
points. To allow this Cylc provides a ``min( )`` function that can be
used as follows:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       initial cycle point = 20100101T03
       [[graph]]
           R1/min(T00,T12) = "prep1 => foo"
           R1/min(T06,T18) = "prep2 => foo"
           T00,T06,T12,T18 = "foo => bar"


In this example the initial cycle point is ``20100101T03``, so the
``prep1`` task will run once at ``20100101T12`` and the
``prep2`` task will run once at ``20100101T06`` as these are
the first cycle points after the initial cycle point in the respective
``min( )`` entries.

.. _IntegerCycling:

Integer Cycling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. tutorial:: Integer Cycling Tutorial <tutorial-integer-cycling>

In addition to non-cycling and :term:`datetime cycling` workflows, Cylc can do
:term:`integer cycling` for cycling workflows that are not datetime based.

To construct an integer cycling workflow, set
:cylc:conf:`[scheduling]cycling mode = integer`, and specify integer values
for the :term:`initial cycle point` and optionally the
:term:`final cycle point`. The syntax for intervals,
offsets, and :term:`recurrences <recurrence>` (sequences) is similar to the
datetime cycling syntax, except for the simple integer values.

The full integer recurrence expressions supported are:

- ``Rn/start-point/interval # e.g. R3/1/P2``
- ``Rn/interval/end-point # e.g. R3/P2/9``

But, as for datetime cycling, sequence start and end points can be omitted
where workflow initial and final cycle points can be assumed. Some examples:

.. code-block:: sub

   R1        # Run once at the initial cycle point
             # (short for R1/initial-point/?)
   P1        # Repeat with step 1 from the initial cycle point
             # (short for R/initial-point/P1)
   P5        # Repeat with step 5 from the initial cycle point
             # (short for R/initial-point/P5)
   R2//P2    # Run twice with step 3 from the initial cycle point
             # (short for R2/initial-point/P2)
   R/+P1/P2  # Repeat with step 2, from 1 after the initial cycle point
   R2/P2     # Run twice with step 2, to the final cycle point
             # (short for R2/P2/final-point)
   R1/P0     # Run once at the final cycle point
             # (short for R1/P0/final-point)

Advanced Integer Cycling Syntax
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The same syntax used to reference the initial and final cycle points
(introduced in :ref:`referencing-the-initial-and-final-cycle-points`) for
use with datetime cycling can also be used for integer cycling. For
example you can write:

.. code-block:: sub

   R1/^     # Run once at the initial cycle point
   R1/$     # Run once at the final cycle point
   R3/^/P2  # Run three times with step two starting at the
                    # initial cycle point

Likewise the syntax introduced in :ref:`excluding-dates` for excluding
a particular point from a recurrence also works for integer cycling. For
example:

.. code-block:: sub

   R/P4!8       # Run with step 4, to the final cycle point but not at point 8
   R3/3/P2!5    # Run with step 2 from point 3 but not at point 5
   R/+P1/P6!14  # Run with step 6 from 1 step after the
                # initial cycle point but not at point 14

Multiple integer exclusions are also valid in the same way as the syntax
in :ref:`excluding-dates`. Integer exclusions may be a list of single
integer points, an integer sequence, or a combination of both:

.. code-block:: sub

   R/P1!(2,3,7)  # Run with step 1 to the final cycle point,
                 # but not at points 2, 3, or 7.
   P1 ! P2       # Run with step 1 from the initial to final
                 # cycle point, skipping every other step from
                 # the initial cycle point.
   P1 ! +P1/P2   # Run with step 1 from the initial cycle point,
                 # excluding every other step beginning one step
                 # after the initial cycle point.
   P1 !(P2,6,8)  # Run with step 1 from the initial cycle point,
                 # excluding every other step, and also excluding
                 # steps 6 and 8.

.. _fig-integer-pipeline:

.. figure::/img/pipe-pub.png
   :align: center

The following workflow definition, as :ref:`graphed above <fig-integer-pipeline>`,
implements a classical linear pipeline using integer cycling. The workflow
ensures that one instance each of A, B, and C runs concurrently and the
pipeline is kept full: when 1/A has finished processing the first dataset, 2/A
can start on the second one at the same time as 1/B begins processing the
output of 1/A, and so on. The artificial cross-cycle dependence ensures that
only one instance of A can run at a time; and similarly B and C. If available
compute resource supports more than three concurrent jobs, remove the
cross-cycle dependence and Cylc will run many cycles at once. Task runtime
configuration is omitted, but it would likely involve retrieving datasets by
cycle point and processing them in cycle point-specific shared workspaces under
the self-contained run directory.

.. _TriggerTypes:

Task Triggering
---------------

A task is said to :term:`trigger` when it submits its job to run, as soon as all of
its dependencies (also known as its separate "triggers") are met. Tasks can
be made to trigger off of the state of other tasks (indicated by a
``:state`` :term:`qualifier` on the upstream task (or family)
name in the graph) and, and off the clock, and arbitrary external events.

External triggering is relatively more complicated, and is documented
separately in :ref:`Section External Triggers`.

Success Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default, with no trigger type specified, is to trigger off of the
upstream task succeeding:

.. code-block:: cylc

   # B triggers if A SUCCEEDS:
   R1 = "A => B"

For consistency and completeness, however, the success trigger can be
explicit:

.. code-block:: cylc

   # B triggers if A SUCCEEDS:
   R1 = "A => B"

   # or:
   R1 = "A:succeed => B"


Failure Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To trigger off of the upstream task failing:

.. code-block:: cylc

   # B triggers if A FAILS:
   R1 = "A:fail => B"


Start Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To trigger off of the upstream task starting:

.. code-block:: cylc

   # B triggers if A STARTS EXECUTING:
   R1 = "A:start => B"

This can be used to trigger tasks that monitor the execution of other tasks,
e.g. to process their output files on the fly as they are generated.
:ref:`MessageTriggers` can also be useful for this use case.


Finish Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To trigger off of the upstream task either succeeding **or** failing:

.. code-block:: cylc

   # B triggers if A either SUCCEEDS or FAILS:
   R1 = "A | A:fail => B"

   # or
   R1 = "A:finish => B"


.. _MessageTriggers:

Message Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. tutorial:: Message Trigger Tutorial <tutorial-cylc-message-triggers>

We can also trigger off of custom task output messages. These must be
registered in the :cylc:conf:`[runtime][<namespace>][outputs]` section
of the emitting task, and sent with ``cylc message`` command.
The graph trigger syntax refers to the item name of the registered
output message. Here's an example workflow that uses message triggers:

.. literalinclude:: ../../workflows/message-triggers/flow.cylc
   :language: cylc


Job Submission Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To trigger off of a task submitting, or failing to submit:

.. code-block:: cylc

   # B triggers if A submits successfully:
   R1 = "A:submit => B"

   # D triggers if C fails to submit successfully:
   R1 = "C:submit-fail => D"

A possible use case for submit-fail triggering: if a task fails to submit,
possibly after multiple retries, another task that inherits (mostly) the same
runtime could be triggered to submit the same job to an alternative platform.


Conditional Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:term:`Conditional triggers <conditional trigger>` allow the configuration of
more advanced task dependencies.

AND operators (``&``) can appear on both sides of an arrow. They
provide a concise alternative to defining multiple triggers separately:

.. code-block:: cylc

   # 1/ this:
   R1 = "A & B => C"

   # is equivalent to:
   R1 = """
       A => C
       B => C
   """

   # 2/ this:
   R1 = "A => B & C"

   # is equivalent to:
   R1 = """
       A => B
       A => C
   """

   # 3/ and this:
   R1 = "A & B => C & D"

   # is equivalent to this:
   R1 = """
       A => C
       B => C
       A => D
       B => D
   """

OR operators (``|``), for conditional triggers, can only appear on the left:

.. code-block:: cylc

   # C triggers when either A or B finishes:
       R1 = "A | B => C"

Any valid conditional expression can be used.

.. Need to use a 'container' directive to get centered image with
   left-aligned caption (as required for code block text).

.. container:: twocol

   .. container:: caption

      *Conditional trigger example*

      .. code-block:: cylc-graph

         # D triggers if A or (B and C) succeed
         A | B & C => D
         # just to align the two graph sections
         D => W
         # Z triggers if (W or X) and Y succeed
         (W|X) & Y => Z

   .. container:: image

      .. _fig-conditional:

      .. figure:: ../../img/conditional-triggers.png
         :align: center


.. _FamilyTriggers:

Family Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:term:`Families <family>` defined by the runtime inheritance hierarchy
(:ref:`User Guide Runtime`) can be used in the graph to :term:`trigger` whole
groups of tasks at the same time (e.g. forecast model ensembles and groups of
tasks for processing different observation types at the same time) and for
triggering downstream tasks off families as a whole. Higher level families,
i.e. families of families, can also be used, and are reduced to the lowest
level member tasks.

.. note::

   Tasks can also trigger off individual family members if necessary.

To trigger an entire task family at once:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           R1 = "foo => FAM"
   [runtime]
       [[FAM]]    # a family (because others inherit from it)
       [[m1,m2]]  # family members (inherit from FAM)
           inherit = FAM

This is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           R1 = "foo => m1 & m2"
   [runtime]
       [[FAM]]
       [[m1,m2]]
           inherit = FAM

To trigger off of a task family you must specify whether the trigger condition
applies to **all** or **any** of the member tasks:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           R1 = """
               # all-member triggers:
               FAM:start-all => one
               FAM:succeed-all => one
               FAM:fail-all => one
               FAM:finish-all => one
               # any-member triggers:
               FAM:start-any => one
               FAM:succeed-any => one
               FAM:fail-any => one
               FAM:finish-any => one
           """

Here's how to trigger downstream processing after if one or more family
members succeed, but only after all members have finished (succeeded or
failed):

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           R1 = """
              FAM:finish-all & FAM:succeed-any => foo
           """


.. _EfficientInterFamilyTriggering:

Efficient Inter-Family Triggering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While Cylc allows writing :term:`dependencies <dependency>` between two
:term:`families <family>` it is important to consider the number of
dependencies this will generate. In the following example, each member of
``FAM2`` has dependencies pointing at all the members of ``FAM1``.

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           R1 = """
               FAM1:succeed-any => FAM2
           """

Expanding this out, you generate ``N * M`` dependencies, where ``N`` is the
number of members of ``FAM1`` and ``M`` is the number of members of ``FAM2``.
This can result in high memory use as the number of family members grows.

You can greatly reduce the number of dependencies generated here by putting
dummy tasks in the graph to represent the state of the upstream family. For
example, if ``FAM2`` should trigger off any member of ``FAM1`` succeeding you
can use a dummy task ``FAM1_done`` like this:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           R1 = """
               FAM1:succeed-any => FAM1_done => FAM2
           """
   [runtime]
   # ...
       [[FAM1_done]]
           script = true
   # ...

This :term:`graph` generates only ``N + M`` dependencies, which takes
significantly less memory and CPU to store and evaluate.


.. _InterCyclePointTriggers:

Intercycle Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most tasks in a workflow typically depend on others with the same
cycle point, but some may depend on other cycle points [1]_.

:term:`Intercycle dependence <intercycle dependency>` is expressed using
``[offset]`` syntax such as ``foo[-PT12H] => foo``, which means ``foo`` at the
current cycle point depends on a previous instance of ``foo`` at 12 hours
before the current cycle point. Unlike for recurrences (e.g. ``T00,T12``),
dependency these offsets are relative to the current cycle point, not the
initial cycle point.

.. code-block:: cylc

   [[graph]]
       # B triggers off A in the previous cycle point
       PT6H = "A[-PT6H] => B"

intercycle and trigger type (or message trigger) syntax can be
combined:

.. code-block:: cylc

   # B triggers if A in the previous cycle point fails:
   PT6H = "A[-PT6H]:fail => B"

For convenience, Cylc automatically ignores intercycle triggers that reach back
beyond the initial cycle point. If something special has to happen at start-up,
``R1`` tasks are the recommended way to make it happen:

  .. code-block:: cylc

     [scheduling]
         [[graph]]
             R1 = "prep1 => prep2"
             R1/T00,R1/T12 = "prep2[^] => foo"
             T00,T12 = "foo[-PT12H] => foo => bar"

Here there is a dependence on the initial ``R1`` task ``prep`` for ``foo`` at
the first ``T00`` cycle point, and at the first ``T12`` cycle point.
Thereafter, ``foo`` just depends on its previous (12 hours ago) instance.

It can also be useful to have specific dependencies on tasks at or near
the initial cycle point. You can switch the context of the offset to be
the initial cycle point by using the caret symbol: ``^``.

For example, ``foo[^]`` means ``foo`` at the initial cycle point, and
``foo[^+PT6H]`` means ``foo`` 6 hours after the initial cycle point. Usually,
this kind of dependency will only apply in a limited number of cycle points
near the start of the workflow, so you may want to write it in an ``R1`` graph.

Finally, dependence on a task at a specific cycle point is also possible:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           R1/20200202 = "baz[20200101] => qux"


.. TODO is this still the case:

.. warning::

   However, in a long running workflow it is best to avoid a repeating cycle
   that depends forever on a specific cycle point (such as the initial point)
   as this can adversely affect the scheduler's performance.

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       initial cycle point = 2010
       [[graph]]
           # Can cause performance issue!
           P1D = "baz[20200101] => qux"


.. _SequentialTasks:

Special Sequential Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tasks that depend on their own previous-cycle instance can be declared as
*sequential*:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[special tasks]]
           # foo depends on its previous instance:
           sequential = foo  # deprecated - see below!
       [[graph]]
           T00,T12 = "foo => bar"

However, this feature is deprecated in favour of explicit intercycle triggers
which expose the associated scheduling behaviour in the graph:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           # foo depends on its previous instance:
           T00,T12 = "foo[-PT12H] => foo => bar"

The sequential declaration is arguably convenient in one unusual situation
though: if a task has a non-uniform cycling sequence then multiple explicit
triggers,

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[graph]]
           T00,T03,T11 = "foo => bar"
           T00 = "foo[-PT13H] => foo"
           T03 = "foo[-PT3H] => foo"
           T11 = "foo[-PT8H] => foo"

can be replaced by a single sequential declaration,

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[special tasks]]
           sequential = foo
       [[graph]]
           T00,T03,T11 = "foo => bar"


Future Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cylc also supports :term:`intercycle triggering <intercycle trigger>` off
tasks "in the future" (with respect to cycle point):

.. code-block:: cylc

   [[graph]]
       T00,T06,T12,T18 = """
           # A runs in this cycle:
           A
           # B in this cycle triggers off A in the next cycle.
           A[PT6H] => B
       """

Future triggers present a problem at workflow shutdown rather than at start-up.
Here, ``B`` at the final cycle point wants to trigger off an instance
of ``A`` that will never exist because it is beyond the workflow stop
point. Consequently Cylc prevents tasks from spawning successors that depend on
other tasks beyond the final point.


.. _ClockTriggerTasks:

Clock Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

   This section describes deprecated old-style clock triggers that are part of
   the task definition. Please consider using :ref:`Built-in Clock Triggers`
   (external triggers) instead.

By default, datetime cycle points are not connected to the :term:`wallclock time`.
In real time cycling systems, however, some tasks may need to trigger at
(or at some offset from) their cycle point in real time.

Cylc points are full datetimes, not just times of the day, so clock-triggers
provide no constraint if the workflow gets sufficiently far behind the clock,
allowing maximum concurrency until the clock-triggered tasks catch up again.

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[special tasks]]
           clock-trigger = foo(PT2H)
       [[graph]]
           T00 = foo

Here, ``2025-08-23T00/foo`` would trigger (other dependencies allowing)
when the wallclock time reaches ``2025-08-23T02``. Clock-trigger
offsets are normally positive, to trigger *after* the wallclock time is equal
to the task cycle point.


.. _ClockExpireTasks:

Clock-Expire Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tasks can be configured to *expire* and skip job submission if they are too far
behind the wallclock when they become ready to run (and other tasks can trigger
off of this).

For example, if a clock-triggered task always copies the latest of a set of
files to overwrite the previous set, in every cycle, there would be no point in
running it late because the files it copied would be immediately overwritten by
the next task instance as the workflow catches back up to real time operation.

Clock-expire tasks are configured with
:cylc:conf:`[scheduling][special tasks]clock-expire` using a syntax like
:cylc:conf:`clock-trigger <[scheduling][special tasks]clock-trigger>`
with a datetime offset relative to cycle point.
The offset should be positive to make the task expire if the wallclock time
has gone beyond the cycle point.

.. warning::

   The scheduler can only determine that a task has expired once it has
   appeared in the active window of the workflow.


.. _WorkflowConfigExternalTriggers:

External Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a substantial topic, documented separately
in :ref:`Section External Triggers`.



.. _User Guide Expected Outputs:
.. _expected outputs:
.. _incomplete tasks:

Expected Outputs
----------------

.. versionadded:: 8.0.0

:term:`Task outputs <task output>` in the :term:`graph` are either
:term:`expected <expected output>` (the default) or  :term:`optional <optional
output>`.

The scheduler expects all task outputs to be completed at runtime, unless they
are marked with ``?`` as optional. This allows it to correctly diagnose
:term:`workflow completion`. [2]_

Tasks that finish without completing expected outputs  [3]_ are retained as
:ref:`incomplete <incomplete tasks>` pending user intervention, e.g. to be
retriggered after a bug fix.

.. note::
   Incomplete tasks stall the workflow if there are no other tasks to run (see
   :ref:`workflow completion`).

   They also count toward the :term:`runahead limit`, because they may
   run again once dealt with.

This graph says task ``bar`` should trigger if ``foo`` succeeds:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   foo => bar  # short for "foo:succeed => bar"

Additionally, ``foo`` is expected to succeed, because its success is not marked
as optional. If ``foo`` does not succeeded, the scheduler will not run ``bar``,
and ``foo`` will be retained as an incomplete task.

Here, ``foo:succeed``, ``bar:x``, and ``baz:fail`` are all expected outputs:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   foo
   bar:x
   baz:fail

Tasks that appear with only custom outputs in the graph are also expected to succeed.
Here, ``foo:succeed`` is an expected output, as well as ``foo:x``, unless it is
marked as optional elsewhere in the graph:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   foo:x => bar

If a task generates multiple custom outputs, they should be "expected" if you
expect them all to be completed every time the task runs. Here,
``model:file1``, ``model:file2``, and ``model:file3`` are all expected outputs:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   model:file1 => proc1
   model:file2 => proc2
   model:file3 => proc3


.. _optional outputs:
.. _User Guide Optional Outputs:

Optional Outputs
----------------

.. versionadded:: 8.0.0

Optional outputs are marked with ``?``. They may or may not be completed by the
task at runtime.

Like the first example above, the following graph says task ``bar`` should
trigger if ``foo`` succeeds:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   foo? => bar  # short for "foo:succeed? => bar"

But now ``foo:succeed`` is optional, so we might expect it to fail sometimes.
And if it does fail, it will not be marked as an incomplete task.

Here, ``foo:succeed``, ``bar:x``, and ``baz:fail`` are all optional outputs:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   foo?
   bar:x?
   baz:fail?


Success and failure (of the same task) are mutually exclusive, so they must
both be optional if one is optional, or if they both appear in the graph:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   foo? => bar
   foo:fail? => baz


.. warning::

   Optional outputs must be marked as optional everywhere they appear in the
   graph, to avoid ambiguity.


If a task generates multiple custom outputs, they should all be declared optional
if you do not expect them to be completed every time the task runs:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   # model:x, :y, and :z are all optional outputs:
   model:x? => proc-x
   model:y? => proc-y
   model:z? => proc-z

This is an example of :term:`graph branching` from optional outputs. Whether a
particular branch is taken or not depends on which optional outputs are
completed at runtime. For more information see :ref:`Graph Branching`.

Leaf tasks (with nothing downstream of them) can have optional outputs. In the
following graph, ``foo`` is expected to succeed, but it doesn't matter whether
``bar`` succeeds or fails:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   foo => bar?


.. note::

   Optional outputs do not affect *triggering*. They just tell the scheduler
   what to do with the task if it finishes without completing the output.

   This graph triggers ``bar`` if ``foo`` succeeds, and does not trigger
   ``bar`` if ``foo`` fails:

   .. code-block:: cylc-graph

      foo => bar

   And so does this graph:

   .. code-block:: cylc-graph

      foo? => bar

   The only difference is whether or not the scheduler regards ``foo`` as
   incomplete if it fails.


Finish Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``foo:finish`` is a pseudo output that is short for ``foo:succeed? |
foo:fail?``. This automatically labels the real outputs as optional, because
success and failure can't both be expected.

``foo:finish?`` is illegal because it incorrectly suggests that "finishing
is optional" and that a non-optional version of the trigger makes sense.

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   # Good:
   R1 = """
      foo:finish => bar
      foo? => baz
   """

   # Error:
   R1 = """
      foo:finish => bar
      foo => baz  # ERROR : foo:succeed must be optional here!
   """

.. _optional outputs.family triggers:

Family Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. (taken from https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4343#issuecomment-913901972)

Family triggers are based on family pseudo outputs such as ``FAM:succeed-all``
and ``FAM:fail-any`` that are short for logical expressions involving the
corresponding member task outputs.

If the member outputs are not singled out explicitly elsewhere in the graph,
then they default to being expected outputs.

For example, if ``f1`` and ``f2`` are members of ``FAM``, then this:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   FAM:fail-all => a


means:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   f1:fail & f2:fail => a  # f1:fail and f2:fail are expected


and this:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   FAM:succeed-any => a


means:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   f1 | f2 => a  # f1:succeed and f2:succeed are expected


However, the family default can be changed to optional by using ``?`` on the
family trigger. So this:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   FAM:fail-all? => a


means this:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   f1:fail? & f2:fail? => a  # f1:fail and f2:fail are optional


If particular member tasks are singled out elsewhere in the graph, that
overrides the family default for expected/optional outputs:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   # f1:fail is expected, and f2:fail is optional:
   FAM:fail-all => a
   f2:fail? => b


Family Finish Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like task ``:finish`` triggers, family ``:finish-all/any`` triggers are
different because ``:finish`` is a pseudo output involving both ``:succeed``
and ``:fail``, which are mutually exclusive outputs that must both be optional
if both are used.

Also like task ``:finish`` triggers, use of ``?`` is illegal on a family
finish trigger, because the underlying member outputs must already be optional.

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   FAM:finish-all => a  # f1:succeed/fail and f2:succeed/fail are optional
   FAM:finish-any => a  # (ditto)

   FAM:finish-all? => b  # ERROR


.. _Graph Branching:

Graph Branching
---------------

Cylc handles workflow :term:`graphs <graph>` in an event-driven way.  It can
automatically follow different paths depending on events at runtime. This
relies on :term:`optional outputs <optional output>` and is called *branching*.

.. note::

   In Cylc 7 and earlier, graphs were not event-driven and needed
   :term:`suicide triggers <suicide trigger>` to clean up unused
   branches at runtime.

   Cylc 8 does not need suicide triggers for branching.

Basic Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here Cylc will follow one of two "branches" depending on the outcome of task ``b``:

* If ``b`` succeeds then the task ``c`` will run.
* If ``b`` fails then the task ``r`` will run.

Task ``d`` will run after either ``c`` or ``r`` succeeds.

.. digraph:: example
   :align: center

   subgraph cluster_success {
      label = ":succeed"
      color = "green"
      fontcolor = "green"
      style = "dashed"

      c
   }

   subgraph cluster_failure {
      label = ":fail"
      color = "red"
      fontcolor = "red"
      style = "dashed"

      r
   }

   a -> b -> c -> d
   b -> r -> d

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   # the success path
   a => b? => c
   # the fail path
   a => b:fail? => r
   # either way, carry on with the rest of the workflow
   c | r => d

The ``?`` symbol denotes an :term:`optional output` which allows the graph to
branch.

Note the last line of the graph ``c | r => d`` allows the graph to
continue on to ``d`` regardless of the path taken. This is an :term:`artificial
dependency`.

Branching is often used for automatic failure recovery. Here's a simple
example:

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   foo => bar
   bar:fail? => recover
   bar? | recover => baz


.. digraph:: Example
   :align: center

   subgraph cluster_1 {
      label = ":fail"
      color = "red"
      fontcolor = "red"
      style = "dashed"

      recover
   }

   foo -> bar
   bar -> recover
   recover -> baz [arrowhead="onormal"]
   bar -> baz [arrowhead="onormal"]


The ``recover`` task would (presumably) analyse the failure of ``bar`` and, if
the right failure mode is confirmed, attempt to generate the right outputs
another way. Then ``baz`` can trigger off of either branch, to process the
outputs.

A more realistic example might have several tasks on each branch. The
``recover`` task could, via inheritance, run the same underlying code as
``bar``, but configured differently to avoid the failure.


Message Trigger Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Branching is particularly powerful when using :ref:`MessageTriggers` (i.e.
:term:`custom outputs <custom output>`) to define multiple parallel paths in
the graph.

In the following graph there is a task called ``showdown`` which produces one
of three possible custom outputs, ``good``, ``bad`` or ``ugly``. Cylc will follow
a different path depending on which of these three outputs is produced.

As with the previous example each path begins with a different :term:`optional
output` of a particular task and ends with an "or" dependency to allow the
workflow to continue regardless of the path taken.

.. code-block:: cylc-graph

   # branch the graph depending on the outcome of "showdown"
   showdown:good? => good
   showdown:bad? => bad
   showdown:ugly? => ugly
   # join the graph back together
   good | bad | ugly => fin


.. digraph:: Example
   :align: center

   subgraph cluster_1 {
      label = ":good"
      color = "green"
      fontcolor = "green"
      style = "dashed"

      good
   }
   subgraph cluster_2 {
      label = ":bad"
      color = "red"
      fontcolor = "red"
      style = "dashed"

      bad
   }
   subgraph cluster_3 {
      label = ":ugly"
      color = "purple"
      fontcolor = "purple"
      style = "dashed"

      ugly
   }
   showdown -> good
   showdown -> bad
   showdown -> ugly
   good -> fin [arrowhead="onormal"]
   bad -> fin [arrowhead="onormal"]
   ugly -> fin [arrowhead="onormal"]


You can test run this example making ``showdown`` randomly generate one of the
three custom outputs:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [runtime]
       [[showdown]]
           # Randomly return one of the three custom outputs.
           script = """
               SEED=$RANDOM
               if ! (( $SEED % 3 )); then
                   cylc message 'The Good'
               elif ! (( ( $SEED + 1 ) % 3 )); then
                   cylc message 'The Bad'
               else
                   cylc message 'The Ugly'
               fi
           """
           [[[outputs]]]
               # Register the three custom outputs.
               good = 'The Good'
               bad = 'The Bad'
               ugly = 'The Ugly'


When using message triggers in this way there are two things to be aware of:

1. Message triggers are not exit states.

   Custom output messages are generated *before* the task has completed, so it
   can be useful to combine them with a regular trigger for safety e.g:

   .. code-block:: cylc-graph

      # good will wait for showdown to finish before running
      showdown:finish & showdown:good => good

      # if showdown fails then good will not run
      showdown:succeed & showdown:good => good

2. Whether message outputs from a single task are mutually exclusive or not
   depends on the task, and the workflow should be designed accordingly.

   For example, the ``showdown`` task above could instead send all three
   messages in succession, after writing out corresponding *good*, *bad*, and
   *ugly* files.

   Check that you understand how your tasks work, if they use custom outputs.


Limiting Workflow Activity
--------------------------

Cylc will usually try to trigger any task with met dependencies. If this
risks running more tasks than you wish - if it would overwhelm the job
platform for example - :ref:`RunaheadLimit` and :ref:`InternalQueues` provide
tools to limit workflow activity.

.. _RunaheadLimit:

Runahead Limiting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runahead limiting, controlled by :cylc:conf:`[scheduling]runahead limit`,
prevents the fastest tasks in a workflow from getting too far
ahead (with respect to cycle point) of the slowest ones.

.. note::

   Runahead limiting does not restrict activity within a cycle point.
   Workflows with a large number of tasks per cycle may need :ref:`internal
   queues <InternalQueues>` to constrain activity in absolute terms.

Succeeded and failed tasks are ignored when computing the runahead limit.

In the following example the runahead limit of ``P5`` (which is also the
default) restricts the active window of the workflow to span a maximum of five
cycle points.

.. code-block:: cylc

    [scheduling]
        initial cycle point = 1
        cycling mode = integer
        runahead limit = P5
        [[graph]]
            P1 = foo

When this workflow is started the tasks ``1/foo`` through ``5/foo`` will be
submitted, but ``6/foo`` (and beyond) are "runahead limited" and will not be
submitted until the earliest tasks finish.

A low runahead limit restricts Cylc's ability to run multiple cycle at once,
but it will not stall the workflow unless it fails to extend out past a future
trigger (see :ref:`InterCyclePointTriggers`).

A high runahead limit allows fast tasks that are not constrained by dependence
on other tasks or clock-triggers to spawn many cycles ahead.
:ref:`Internal queues <InternalQueues>` may be needed as well, if this would
result in too many tasks submitting at once.


.. _InternalQueues:

Internal Queues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Large workflows can potentially overwhelm the system by submitting too many
jobs at once. Internal queues can prevent this by limiting the number of
tasks that can be active (submitted or running) at the same time.

Internal queues are FIFO (first-in-first-out): tasks are released in the same
order that they were queued. They are configured under
:cylc:conf:`[scheduling][queues]` with a *name*; a list of *members* assigned
by task or family name; and a *limit*, which is the maximum number of active
members allowed.

By default every task is assigned to the ``default`` queue, which by default
has a zero limit (interpreted by Cylc as no limit). To use a single queue for
the whole workflow just set the default queue limit:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[queues]]
           # limit the entire workflow to 5 active tasks at once
           [[[default]]]
               limit = 5

To use additional queues just name them, set limits, and assign members:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       [[queues]]
           [[[q_foo]]]
               limit = 5
               members = foo, bar, baz

Any tasks not assigned to a particular queue will remain in the default
queue. The following example illustrates how queues work by running two task
trees side by side, limited to 2 and 3 tasks respectively:

.. literalinclude:: ../../workflows/queues/flow.cylc
   :language: cylc


Valid Task Cycle Points
-----------------------

Graph triggers determine the sequence of valid cycle points (via the
recurrence value of the associated graph string) and the prerequisites, for
each downstream task in a dependency. In the absence of a cycle point offset
(intercycle trigger) they also determine the sequence of cycle points for
the upstream tasks:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       initial cycle point = 2025-01-01T00
       [[graph]]
           P2D = "foo & bar => baz"

This says ``baz`` depends on ``foo`` and ``bar`` for every point in the
sequence defined by the recurrence ``P2D`` (i.e. ``R/^/P2D``).

Cylc does not infer the cyclepoint sequence for upstream tasks in intercycle
triggers, however. All tasks must be tied to the right sequence by appearing
somewhere in the graph with no offset. This prevents unintentional creation of
off-sequence tasks by an offset error in the graph.

For instance, the following example fails validation with *no cycling sequences
defined for ``foo``*:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       initial cycle point = 2025-01-01T00
       [[graph]]
           # ERROR!
           P2D = "foo[-P1D] & bar"

To fix this, ``foo`` should be explicitly tied to the ``P2D`` cycle, and the
correct offset used:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       initial cycle point = 2025-01-01T00
       [[graph]]
           P2D = """
               foo
               foo[-P2D] & bar
           """

Or it should be explicitly tied to the intermediate cycle, if the ``P1D`` offset
is actually correct:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       initial cycle point = 2025-01-01T00
       [[graph]]
           R/+P1D/P2D = foo  # day 2, 4, 6, ...
           P2D = "foo[-P1D] & bar"  # day 1, 3, 5, ...


Note that validation does not detect this sort of error if the target task has
cyclepoint sequences defined but the offset does not land on them. For example,
the following graph will validate but ``bar`` will only run once in the first
cycle point (where its pre-initial dependence is ignored):

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       initial cycle point = 2025-01-01T00
       [[graph]]
           P2D = """
               foo
               foo[-P1D] => bar  # ERROR: foo doesn't exist at -P1D
           """

To fix this, the offset ``[-P1D]`` should be changed to ``[-P2D]``, or else
another graph line is needed to generate ``foo`` instances on the ``P1D`` sequence:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       initial cycle point = 2025-01-01T00
       [[graph]]
           P1D = "foo"
           P2D = "foo[-P1D] => bar"


Omitting Tasks
--------------

It can sometimes be useful to temporarily remove tasks by simply commenting
them out of the graph. Validation warns about tasks defined under
:cylc:conf:`[runtime]` but not used in the graph, as a reminder to restore them
or remove them.

You can also use logical Jinja2 switches (:ref:`User Guide Jinja2`) to
include or exclude tasks (or anything else) from workflow.

.. [1] For example, in weather forecasting workflows (and similar systems) each
       new forecast depends partly on the outcome of the previous forecast.

.. [2] By distinguishing graph branches that did not run but should have, from
   those that did not run but were optional.

.. [3] This includes failed job submission, when the ``:submit`` output is not
   marked as optional.
