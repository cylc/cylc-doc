Quick Summary Of Changes
========================


Terminology
-----------

Cylc now uses simpler more widely understood terms for several core concepts.

.. table::

   =============     ==============
   Cylc 7 Term       Cylc 8 Term
   =============     ==============
   suite             **workflow**
   batch system      **job runner**
   suite daemon      **scheduler**
   =============     ==============

The workflow configuration file has changed from ``suite.rc`` to ``flow.cylc``.


Cylc 7 Compatibility Mode
-------------------------

The old ``suite.rc`` filename triggers a :ref:`backward
compatibility mode<cylc_7_compat_mode>` in Cylc 8 which supports Cylc 7
workflow configruations out of the box, with the following caveats:

.. warning::

   Cylc 6 syntax deprecated by Cylc 7 is now obsolete. Run ``cylc validate``
   *with Cylc 7* on your ``suite.rc`` to check for deprecation warnings and fix
   those before validating with Cylc 8.

.. warning::

   Check for any use of Cylc commands in task scripting. Some Cylc 7 commands
   have been removed and some others now behave differently.
   See :ref:`command line interface changes<MajorChangesCLI>`.

.. warning::

   Cylc 8 does not support
   :ref:`excluding tasks at start-up<MajorChangesExcludingTasksAtStartup>`.
   If your workflow used this old functionality, it may have been used in
   combination with the ``cylc insert`` command (which has been removed from
   Cylc 8) and ``cylc remove`` (which still exists but is much less needed).

.. warning::

   Cylc 8 cannot *restart* a Cylc 7 workflow mid-run. Instead, :ref:`install
   <Workflow Installation>` the workflow to a new run directory and start it
   from scratch at the right cycle point or task(s):

   - ``cylc play --start-cycle-point=<cycle>`` (c.f. Cylc 7 *warm start*), or
   - ``cylc play --start-task=<cycle/task>``   (Cylc 8 can start anywhere in the graph)

   Any previous-cycle workflow data needed by the new run will need to be
   manually copied over from the original run directory.


Upgrading To Cylc 8
-------------------

To take advantage of new Cylc 8 features run ``cylc validate`` (with Cylc 8)
on your workflow and take action on any warnings then rename the workflow
configuration file from ``suite.rc`` to ``flow.cylc``.

If your workflow features :term:`graph branching` you may need to upgrade it
to use :term:`optional outputs <optional output>`.


Architecture
------------

.. seealso::

   - Technical Reference: :ref:`architecture-reference`

The main Cylc 8 system components are:

- **Cylc Scheduler**
     - The workflow engine core, Python 3 based
     - Includes the **CLI** (Command Line Interface)
     - And **TUI**, a new Terminal UI application

- **Cylc Hub**
   - Authenticates users, spawns and proxies Cylc UI Servers
   - Can run as a regular or privileged user
   - (The Hub is a `Jupyterhub <https://jupyter.org/hub>`_ instance)

- **Cylc UI Server**
   - Interacts with Schedulers and the filesystem
   - Serves the UI to users
   - Can be launched by the privileged Hub, for multi-user installations
   - Or run standalone for use by a single user
   - (The UI Server is a `Jupyter Server
     <https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io>`_ extension)

- **Cylc UI**
   - In-browser web UI, includes:
   - A dashboard with summary information and documentation links
   - Integrated gscan (multi-workflow) side-panel
   - Responsive web design (from desktop to table to mobile)
   - Tabbed interface to display multiple workflow views
   - Command integration for interacting with task, jobs, and schedulers

- **Network layers**
   - Incremental push updates (c.f. polled full-state updates in Cylc 7)

Scheduling Algorithm
--------------------

.. seealso::

   User Guide:

   * :ref:`User Guide Expected Outputs`
   * :ref:`User Guide Optional Outputs`
   * :ref:`user-guide-reflow`
   * :ref:`n-window`

Cylc can manage infinite workflows of repeating tasks:

.. image:: ../img/cycling.png
   :align: center

Cylc 8 has a new scheduling algorithm that:
   - Is much more efficient because it only has to manage active tasks

     - waiting tasks are not pre-spawned before they are needed
     - succeeded tasks are not kept across the active task window
     - no costly indiscriminate dependency matching is done
   - Distinguishes between :term:`optional <optional output>` and
     :term:`expected <expected output>` task outputs, to support:

     - :term:`graph branching` without :term:`suicide triggers <suicide trigger>`
     - correct diagnosis of :term:`workflow completion`
   - Causes no implicit dependence on previous-instance job submit

     - instances of same task can run out of cycle point order
     - the workflow will not unnecessarily stall downstream of failed tasks
   - Provides a sensible active-task based window on the evolving workflow

     - (to fully understand which tasks appeared in the Cylc 7 GUI you had to
       understand the scheduling algorithm)
   - Supports a powerful new capability called :term:`reflow`: you can trigger
     multiple concurrent flows in the same graph at once, managed by the same
     scheduler
   - Can start a workflow from any task or tasks in the graph (no need for
     checkpoint restart)
   - Can limit activity within as well as across cycles, without risking a stall


Task/Job States
---------------

.. seealso::

   - User Guide :ref:`task-job-states`

:term:`Tasks <task>` are nodes in the abstract workflow graph representing
processes that should run once their prerequisites are satisfied. :term:`Jobs
<job>` are the real processes submitted to execute these tasks (or at least, at
the submission stage, real job scripts). A task can have multiple jobs, by
automatic retries and manual re-triggering.

Cylc 7 had 13 task/job states. The GUI only showed tasks, with job data
from the latest task job.

Cylc 8 has only 8 task/job states. The Cylc 8 UI shows both task and jobs.
Task icons are monochrome circles; job icons are coloured squares. The running
task icon incorporates a radial progress indicator.

.. image:: ../img/task-job.png
   :align: center

The task states removed since Cylc 7 have been absorbed into *waiting*, but
you can see or infer what is being waited on: e.g. a queue, xtrigger, or retry
timer. For instance, a waiting task that already has associated jobs is going
to retry.


Optional and Expected Task Outputs
----------------------------------

.. seealso::

   User Guide:

   * :ref:`User Guide Expected Outputs`
   * :ref:`User Guide Optional Outputs`

   Major Changes:

   * :ref:`728.suicide_triggers`


Cylc 8 distinguishes between :term:`expected <expected output>` and
:term:`optional <optional output>` task outputs. This supports optional
:term:`graph branching` and it allows the scheduler to correctly diagnose
:term:`workflow completion`.

If a task :term:`job` finishes without completing an expected output the
scheduler will retain it, pending user intervention, as an :term:`incomplete
task`.

A task can finish with or without completing optional outputs, on the other
hand. The primary use for optional outputs is alternate path branching in the
graph.

If there is nothing left to do, but incomplete tasks are present, the scheduler
will conclude that the workflow did not run to completion as expected and will
:term:`stall` rather than shut down.


Window on the Workflow
----------------------

.. seealso::

   * User Guide :ref:`n-window`


.. image:: ../img/n-window.png
   :align: center

The Cylc UI can't show "all the tasks" at once because the graph may be huge,
or even infinite in extent in cycling systems. The Cylc 8 UI shows:

- Current **active tasks** (submitted, running) plus tasks waiting on scheduler
  constraints (queues, runahead limit, clock triggers) and external triggers

- Tasks up to ``n`` graph edges away from active tasks (default ``1`` edge)


Platform Awareness
------------------

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`Platforms at Cylc 8. <majorchangesplatforms>`
   - :ref:`System admin's guide to writing platforms. <AdminGuide.PlatformConfigs>`

Cylc 7 was aware of individual job hosts.

.. code-block:: cylc

   [runtime]
      [[model]]
          [[[remote]]]
              host = hpc1.login.1  # Deprecated Cylc 8

Cylc 8 is aware of host groups specified as :term:`[job] platforms <platform>`
in the global configuration. Platform hosts share a file system and :term:`job
runner`. If a host becomes unavailable Cylc 8 can use other hosts on the same
platform to interact with task jobs.

.. code-block:: cylc

   [runtime]
      [[model]]
          platform = hpc1  # Cylc 8
          # (Platform hosts and job runner defined in global config).
      [[model_cleanup]]
          # Platforms can have the same hosts with different job runners.
          platform = hpc1_background


.. warning::

   Cylc 8 will pick a sensible platform for your Cylc 7 settings,
   These deprecated settings will be removed at Cylc 9.


.. _7-to-8.summary.graph_syntax:

Graph Syntax
------------

Cylc 7 had unnecessarily deep nesting of graph config sections:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
      initial cycle point = now
      [[dependencies]]  # Deprecated Cylc 7
          [[[R1]]]
              graph = "prep => foo"
          [[[R/^/P1D]]]
              graph = "foo => bar => baz"

Cylc 8 cleans this up:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
      initial cycle point = now
      [[graph]]  # Cylc 8
          R1 = "prep => foo"
          R/^/P1D = "foo => bar => baz"

.. _Workflow Installation:


Workflow Installation
---------------------

The functionality of ``rose suite-run`` has been migrated into Cylc 8.

Cylc Install
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`Moving to Cylc Install<majorchangesinstall>`.


Cylc install cleanly separates workflow source directory from run directory,
and installs workflow files into the run directory at start-up.

- ``cylc install`` copies workflow source files to a dedicated run-directory

- :term:`source directory` locations can be set in global config

- each install creates a new numbered :term:`run directory` (by default)

.. code-block:: console

   $ pwd
   ~/cylc-src/demo

   $ ls
   flow.cylc

   $ cylc install
   INSTALLED demo/run1 from /home/oliverh/cylc-src/demo

   $ cylc play demo
   ...
   demo/run1: oliver.niwa.local PID=6702

   $ cylc install
   INSTALLED demo/run2 from /home/oliverh/cylc-src/demo

   $ cylc play demo
   ...
   demo/run2: oliver.niwa.local PID=6962

Workflows can be deleted with ``cylc clean`` - see :ref:`Removing-workflows`. This
replaces the ``rose suite-clean`` functionality.

.. note::

   Cylc 8 forbids having both ``flow.cylc`` and ``suite.rc`` files in the same
   :term:`run directory` or :term:`source directory`.

File Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of the ``rose suite-run`` migration to Cylc, files are now installed onto
platforms. This is part of the remote initialization process which is triggered
when the first job runs on the platform.
The remote installation, as standard, includes the directories ``app``, ``bin``,
``etc`` and ``lib``. Extra files and directories can be included in this file
installation, under the :cylc:conf:`[scheduler]install` section of your
``flow.cylc`` file.

For more information, see :ref:`installing_files`.

Symlink Dirs
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`SymlinkDirs`
   * :ref:`RemoteInit`

Symlinking the workflow directories used by Cylc provides a useful way of
managing disk space.

These symlinks are created on a per install target basis, as configured in
:cylc:conf:`global.cylc[install][symlink dirs]`. Install targets are managed on
a site level, for more information see :ref:`Install Targets`.

This functionality replaces the Rose ``root dir`` configuration
for Cylc 7 (however, note it does not allow per-workflow configuration).


Safe Run Semantics
------------------

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`728.play_pause_stop`
   - User Guide :ref:`WorkflowStartUp`

Cylc 7 run semantics were somewhat dangerous: if you accidentally typed ``cylc run``
instead of ``cylc restart`` a new run from scratch would overwrite the existing
run directory, preventing a return to the intended restart.

Cylc 8 has ``cylc pause`` to:

- pause a workflow (halt all job submission)

And ``cylc play`` to:

- start,
- restart, and
- release a paused workflow

So *restart* is now the safe default behaviour. For a new run from scratch,
do a fresh ``cylc install`` and play it safely in the new run directory.

(Note that ``cylc hold`` and ``cylc release`` pause and release individual tasks.)


Security
--------

.. seealso::

   Technical reference:

   * :ref:`CylcUIServer.architecture`

- In a multi-user context, users authenticate at the Hub, which
  spawns Cylc UI Servers as the target user (workflow owner).
- In a single user context, the UI Server can be started directly,
  with token-based authentication.
- The UI Server interacts with its own Schedulers, which also run as the user.
- Users can authorize different levels of access to others, via their UI Server.
- Workflow task jobs authenticate to their parent scheduler using `CurveZMQ`_.
- Cylc8 supports target users authorizing other users to interact with their
  workflows on the UI.

.. note::

   The authorization system in Cylc 8 is complete but we haven't yet provided
   easy access to other users' workflows via the UI. For the time being
   use the address bar to change user name in the URL.


Packaging
---------

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`installation`


Cylc 7 had to be installed from a release tarball, and its software dependencies
had to be installed manually.

Cylc 8 and its core software dependencies can be installed quickly from Conda
Forge, into a conda environment; or from PyPI, into a Python 3 virtual environment.


Task Job Scripts
----------------

.. seealso::

   * User Guide :ref:`JobScripts`


All user-defined task scripting now runs in a subshell, so you can safely
switch Python environments inside tasks without affecting Cylc.


Time Zones
----------

.. seealso::

   - User Guide :ref:`writing_flows.scheduling.syntax_rules`


:cylc:conf:`[scheduler]cycle point time zone` now defaults to UTC, unless you
are working in :ref:`cylc_7_compat_mode`.


Runahead Limit & Queues
-----------------------

The default runahead limit has been increased from three cycles to five.

:ref:`InternalQueues` are now more efficient (for the :term:`scheduler`),
we now recommend using queues to restrict the number of running tasks in
situations where graphing may have been used previously.
