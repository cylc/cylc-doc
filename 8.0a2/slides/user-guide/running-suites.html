<h1>Running Suites<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#running-suites" title="View HTML">§</a></h1>

<p>This chapter currently features a diverse collection of topics related
to running suites.</p>




</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="suite-start-up">

<h2>Suite Start-Up<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#suite-start-up" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>There are three ways to start a suite running: <em>cold start</em> and <em>warm start</em>,
which start from scratch; and <em>restart</em>, which starts from a prior
suite state checkpoint. The only difference between cold starts and warm starts
is that warm starts start from a point beyond the suite initial cycle point.</p>
<p>Once a suite is up and running it is typically a restart that is needed most
often (but see also <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">reload</span></code>). <em>Be aware that cold and warm
starts wipe out prior suite state, so you can’t go back to a restart if you
decide you made a mistake.</em></p>




</article>
<article class="slide level-3" id="cold-start">

<h3>Cold Start<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#cold-start" title="View HTML">§</a></h3>

<p>A cold start is the primary way to start a suite run from scratch:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc run SUITE <span class="o">[</span>INITIAL_CYCLE_POINT<span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The initial cycle point may be specified on the command line or in the suite.rc
file. The scheduler starts by loading the first instance of each task at the
suite initial cycle point, or at the next valid point for the task.</p>




</article>
<article class="slide level-3" id="warm-start">

<h3>Warm Start<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#warm-start" title="View HTML">§</a></h3>

<p>A warm start runs a suite from scratch like a cold start, but from the
beginning of a given cycle point that is beyond the suite initial cycle point.
This is generally inferior to a <em>restart</em> (which loads a previously
recorded suite state - see <a class="reference internal" href="#restartingsuites"><span class="std std-ref">Restart and Suite State Checkpoints</span></a>) because it may result in
some tasks rerunning. However, a warm start may be required if a restart is not
possible, e.g. because the suite run database was accidentally deleted. The
warm start cycle point must be given on the command line:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc run --warm SUITE <span class="o">[</span>START_CYCLE_POINT<span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The original suite initial cycle point is preserved, but all tasks and
dependencies before the given warm start cycle point are ignored.</p>
<p>The scheduler starts by loading a first instance of each task at the warm
start cycle point, or at the next valid point for the task.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R1</span></code>-type tasks behave exactly the same as other tasks - if their
cycle point is at or later than the given start cycle point, they will run; if
not, they will be ignored.</p>

<article class="slide level-3" id="restart-and-suite-state-checkpoints">

<h3>Behaviour of Tasks on Restart<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#behaviour-of-tasks-on-restart" title="View HTML">§</a></h3>

<p>At restart (see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">restart</span> <span class="pre">--help</span></code>) a suite server program
initializes its task pool from a previously recorded checkpoint state. By
default the latest automatic checkpoint - which is updated with every task
state change - is loaded so that the suite can carry on exactly as it was just
before being shut down or killed.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc restart SUITE
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Tasks recorded in the “submitted” or “running” states are automatically polled
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#task-job-polling"><span class="std std-ref">Task Job Polling</span></a>) at start-up to determine what happened to
them while the suite was down.</p>
<div class="section level-4" id="restart-from-latest-checkpoint">
<p>To restart from the latest checkpoint simply invoke the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">restart</span></code>
command with the suite name.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc restart SUITE
</pre></div>
</div>
</div><div class="section level-4" id="restart-from-another-checkpoint">
<p>Suite server programs automatically update the “latest” checkpoint every time
a task changes state, and at every suite restart, but you can also take
checkpoints at other times. To tell a suite server program to checkpoint its
current state:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc checkpoint SUITE-NAME CHECKPOINT-NAME
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The 2nd argument is a name to identify the checkpoint later with:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc ls-checkpoints SUITE-NAME
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For example, with checkpoints named “bob”, “alice”, and “breakfast”:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc ls-checkpoints SUITE-NAME
<span class="c1">#######################################################################</span>
<span class="c1"># CHECKPOINT ID (ID|TIME|EVENT)</span>
<span class="m">1</span><span class="p">|</span><span class="m">2017</span>-11-01T15:48:34+13<span class="p">|</span>bob
<span class="m">2</span><span class="p">|</span><span class="m">2017</span>-11-01T15:48:47+13<span class="p">|</span>alice
<span class="m">3</span><span class="p">|</span><span class="m">2017</span>-11-01T15:49:00+13<span class="p">|</span>breakfast

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To see the actual task state content of a given checkpoint ID (if you need to),
for the moment you have to interrogate the suite DB, e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ sqlite3 ~/cylc-run/SUITE-NAME/log/db <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;select * from task_pool_checkpoints where id == 3;&#39;</span>

suite, including any tasks that are currently active, so you may want
to be careful where you do it. Tasks recorded as active are polled
automatically on restart to determine what happened to them.</p>
</div>
<p>The checkpoint ID 0 (zero) is always used for latest state of the suite, which
is updated continuously as the suite progresses. The checkpoint IDs of earlier
states are positive integers starting from 1, incremented each time a new
checkpoint is stored. Currently suites automatically store checkpoints before
and after reloads, and on restarts (using the latest checkpoints before the
restarts).</p>
<p>Once you have identified the right checkpoint, restart the suite like this:</p>

it may be recorded in the waiting state and, if its upstream dependencies

<h2>Reloading The Suite Configuration At Runtime<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#reloading-the-suite-configuration-at-runtime" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">reload</span></code> command tells a suite server program to reload its
suite configuration at run time. This is an alternative to shutting a
suite down and restarting it after making changes.</p>
<p>As for a restart, existing instances of tasks removed from the suite
configuration before reload are not removed from the task pool
automatically, but they will not spawn new instances. They can be removed
manually if necessary, with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">remove</span></code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, instances of new tasks added to the suite configuration before
reload are not inserted into the pool automatically. The first instance of each
must be inserted manually at the right cycle point, with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">insert</span></code>.</p>

<h2>The Suite Contact File<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#the-suite-contact-file" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>At start-up, suite server programs write a <em>suite contact file</em>
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$HOME/cylc-run/SUITE/.service/contact</span></code> that records suite host,
user, port number, process ID, Cylc version, and other information. Client
commands can read this file, if they have access to it, to find the target
suite server program.</p>

<article class="slide level-2" id="task-job-polling">

<h2>Task Job Polling<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#task-job-polling" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>At any point after job submission task jobs can be <em>polled</em> to check that
their true state conforms to what is currently recorded by the suite server
program.  See <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">poll</span> <span class="pre">--help</span></code> for how to poll one or more tasks
manually.</p>
<p>Polling may be necessary if, for example, a task job gets killed by the
untrappable SIGKILL signal (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kill</span> <span class="pre">-9</span> <span class="pre">PID</span></code>), or if a network
outage prevents task success or failure messages getting through, or if the
suite server program itself is down when tasks finish execution.</p>
<p>To poll a task job the suite server program interrogates the
batch system, and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">job.status</span></code> file, on the job host. This
information is enough to determine the final task status even if the
job finished while the suite server program was down or unreachable on
the network.</p>




</article>
<article class="slide level-3" id="routine-polling">

<h3>Routine Polling<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#routine-polling" title="View HTML">§</a></h3>

<p>Task jobs are automatically polled at certain times: once on job submission
timeout; several times on exceeding the job execution time limit; and at suite
restart any tasks recorded as active in the suite state checkpoint are polled
to find out what happened to them while the suite was down.</p>
<p>Finally, in necessary routine polling can be configured as a way to track job
status on job hosts that do not allow networking routing back to the suite host
for task messaging by TCP or SSH. See <a class="reference internal" href="#polling-to-track-job-status"><span class="std std-ref">Polling to Track Job Status</span></a>.</p>




</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="tracking-task-state">

<h2>Tracking Task State<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#tracking-task-state" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>Cylc supports three ways of tracking task state on job hosts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>task-to-suite messaging via TCP (using ZMQ protocol)</li>
<li>task-to-suite messaging via non-interactive SSH to the suite host,
then local TCP</li>
<li>regular polling by the suite server program</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be configured per job host using
<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/config/global.html#flow.rc[hosts][&lt;hostname glob&gt;]task communication method" title="flow.rc[hosts][&lt;hostname glob&gt;]task communication method"><code class="xref cylc cylc-conf docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">flow.rc[hosts][&lt;hostname</span> <span class="pre">glob&gt;]task</span> <span class="pre">communication</span> <span class="pre">method</span></code></a>.</p>
<p>If your site prohibits TCP and SSH back from job hosts to
suite hosts, before resorting to the polling method you should
consider installing dedicated Cylc servers or
VMs inside the HPC trust zone (where TCP and SSH should be allowed).</p>
<p>It is also possible to run Cylc suite server programs on HPC login
nodes, but this is not recommended for load and run duration,</p>
<p>Finally, it has been suggested that <em>port forwarding</em> may provide another
solution - but that is beyond the scope of this document.</p>




</article>
<article class="slide level-3" id="tcp-task-messaging">

<h3>TCP Task Messaging<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#tcp-task-messaging" title="View HTML">§</a></h3>

<p>Task job wrappers automatically invoke <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">message</span></code> to report
progress back to the suite server program when they begin executing,
at normal exit (success) and abnormal exit (failure).</p>
<p>By default the messaging occurs via an authenticated, TCP connection to the
suite server program using the ZMQ protocol.
This is the preferred task communications method - it is efficient and direct.</p>
<p>Suite server programs automatically install suite contact information
and credentials on job hosts.  Users only need to do this manually
for remote access to suites on other hosts, or suites owned by other
users - see <a class="reference internal" href="#remotecontrol"><span class="std std-ref">Remote Control</span></a>.</p>




</article>
<article class="slide level-3" id="ssh-task-messaging">

<h3>Ssh Task Messaging<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#ssh-task-messaging" title="View HTML">§</a></h3>

<p>Cylc can be configured to re-invoke task messaging commands on the
suite host via non-interactive SSH (from job host to suite host).
Then a local TCP connection is made to the suite server program.</p>
<p>(User-invoked client commands
can do the same thing with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--use-ssh</span></code> command option).</p>
<p>This is less efficient than direct TCP messaging, but it may be useful at
sites where the TCP ports are blocked but non-interactive SSH is allowed.</p>




</article>
<article class="slide level-3" id="polling-to-track-job-status">

<h3>Polling to Track Job Status<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#polling-to-track-job-status" title="View HTML">§</a></h3>

<p>Finally, suite server programs can actively poll task jobs at
configurable intervals, via non-interactive SSH to the job host.</p>
<p>Polling is the least efficient task communications method because task state is
updated only at intervals, not when task events actually occur.  However, it
may be needed at sites that do not allow TCP or non-interactive SSH from job
host to suite host.</p>
<p>Be careful to avoid spamming task hosts with polling commands. Each poll
opens (and then closes) a new SSH connection.</p>
<p>Polling intervals are configurable under <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[runtime]</span></code> because
they should may depend on the expected execution time. For instance, a
task that typically takes an hour to run might be polled every 10
minutes initially, and then every minute toward the end of its run.
Interval values are used in turn until the last value, which is used
repeatedly until finished:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[runtime]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[foo]]</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[job]]]</span>
            <span class="c1"># poll every minute in the &#39;submitted&#39; state:</span>
            <span class="nv">submission polling intervals </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> PT1M</span>
            <span class="c1"># poll one minute after foo starts running, then every 10</span>
            <span class="c1"># minutes for 50 minutes, then every minute until finished:</span>
            <span class="nv">execution polling intervals </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> PT1M, 5*PT10M, PT1M</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A list of intervals with optional multipliers can be used for both
submission and execution polling, although a single value is probably
sufficient for submission polling. If these items are not configured
default values from site and user global config will be used for the polling
task communication method; polling is not done by default under the
other task communications methods (but it can still be used if you
like).</p>

<h2>The Suite Service Directory<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#the-suite-service-directory" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>At registration time a <em>suite service directory</em>,

with a private passphrase file (containing random text), a self-signed
SSL certificate (see <a class="reference internal" href="#connectionauthentication"><span class="std std-ref">Client-Server Interaction</span></a>), and a symlink to the
suite source directory.  An existing passphrase file will not be overwritten
if a suite is re-registered.</p>
<p>At run time, the private suite run database is also written to the service
directory, along with a <em>suite contact file</em> that records the host,
user, port number, process ID, Cylc version, and other information about the
suite server program. Client commands automatically read daemon targetting

<h3>Full Control - With Auth Files<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#full-control-with-auth-files" title="View HTML">§</a></h3>

<p>Suite auth files (passphrase and SSL certificate) give full control. They are
loaded from the suite service directory by the suite server program at
start-up, and used to authenticate subsequent client connections. Passphrases
are used in a secure encrypted challenge-response scheme, never sent in plain
text over the network.</p>
<p>If two users need access to the same suite server program, they must both
possess the passphrase file for that suite. Fine-grained access to a single
suite server program via distinct user accounts is not currently supported.</p>
<p>Suite server programs automatically install their auth and contact files to job
hosts via SSH, to enable task jobs to connect back to the suite server program
for task messaging.</p>
<p>Client programs invoked by the suite owner automatically load the passphrase,
SSL certificate, and contact file too, for automatic connection to suites.</p>
<p><em>Manual installation of suite auth files is only needed for remote control,
if you do not have a shared filesystem - see below.</em></p>

<h2>Remote Control<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#remote-control" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>Cylc client programs can interact with suite server
programs running on other accounts or hosts. How this works depends on whether
or not you have:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a <em>shared filesystem</em> such that you see the same home directory on
both hosts.</li>
<li><em>non-interactive SSH</em> from the client account to the server
account.</li>
</ul>
<p>With a shared filesystem, a suite registered on the remote (server) host is
also - in effect - registered on the local (client) host.  In this case you
can invoke client commands without the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--host</span></code> option; the client
will automatically read the host and port from the contact file in the
suite service directory.</p>
<p>To control suite server programs running under other user accounts or on other
hosts without a shared filesystem, the suite SSL certificate and passphrase
must be installed under your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$HOME/.cylc/</span></code> directory:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.cylc/auth/OWNER@HOST/SUITE/

<p>where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OWNER&#64;HOST</span></code> is the suite host account and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SUITE</span></code>
is the suite name. Client commands should then be invoked with the

<article class="slide level-2" id="runahead-limiting">

<h2>Runahead Limiting<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#runahead-limiting" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>Runahead limiting prevents the fastest tasks in a suite from getting too far
ahead of the slowest ones. Newly spawned tasks are released to the task pool
only when they fall below the runahead limit. A low runhead limit can prevent
cylc from interleaving cycles, but it will not stall a suite unless it fails to
extend out past a future trigger (see <a class="reference internal" href="writing-suites.html#intercyclepointtriggers"><span class="std std-ref">Inter-Cycle Triggers</span></a>).
A high runahead limit may allow fast tasks that are not constrained by
dependencies or clock-triggers to spawn far ahead of the pack, which could have
performance implications for the suite server program when running very large
suites.  Succeeded and failed tasks are ignored when computing the runahead
limit.</p>
<p>The preferred runahead limiting mechanism restricts the number of consecutive
active cycle points. The default value is three active cycle points, this
is configured by <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/config/suite.html#suite.rc[scheduling]max active cycle points" title="suite.rc[scheduling]max active cycle points"><code class="xref cylc cylc-conf docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[scheduling]max</span> <span class="pre">active</span> <span class="pre">cycle</span> <span class="pre">points</span></code></a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively the interval between the
slowest and fastest tasks can be specified as hard limit by configuring

<h2>Limiting Activity With Internal Queues<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#limiting-activity-with-internal-queues" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>Large suites can potentially overwhelm task hosts by submitting too many
tasks at once. You can prevent this with <em>internal queues</em>, which
limit the number of tasks that can be active (submitted or running)
at the same time.</p>
<p>Internal queues behave in the first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner, i.e. tasks are
released from a queue in the same order that they were queued.</p>
<p>A queue is defined by a <em>name</em>; a <em>limit</em>, which is the maximum
number of active tasks allowed for the queue; and a list of <em>members</em>,
assigned by task or family name.</p>
<p>Queue configuration is done under the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[scheduling]</span></code> section of the suite.rc
file (like dependencies, internal queues constrain <em>when</em> a task runs).</p>
<p>By default every task is assigned to the <em>default</em> queue, which by default
has a zero limit (interpreted by cylc as no limit). To use a single queue for
the whole suite just set the default queue limit:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[queues]]</span>
        <span class="c1"># limit the entire suite to 5 active tasks at once</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[default]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">limit </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> 5</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To use additional queues just name each one, set their limits, and assign
members:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[queues]]</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[q_foo]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">limit </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> 5</span>
            <span class="nv">members </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> foo, bar, baz</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Any tasks not assigned to a particular queue will remain in the default
queue. The <em>queues</em> example suite illustrates how queues work by
running two task trees side by side each
limited to 2 and 3 tasks respectively:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[meta]</span>

<h3>Late Events<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#late-events" title="View HTML">§</a></h3>

<p>You may want to be notified when certain tasks are running late in a real time
production system - i.e. when they have not triggered by <em>the usual time</em>.
Tasks of primary interest are not normally clock-triggered however, so their
trigger times are mostly a function of how the suite runs in its environment,
and even external factors such as contention with other suites <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id17" id="id8">[3]</a> .</p>
<p>But if your system is reasonably stable from one cycle to the next such that a
given task has consistently triggered by some interval beyond its cycle point,
you can configure Cylc to emit a <em>late event</em> if it has not triggered by
that time. For example, if a task <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">forecast</span></code> normally triggers by 30
minutes after its cycle point, configure late notification for it like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[runtime]</span>
   <span class="nt">[[forecast]]</span>
        <span class="nv">script </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> run-model.sh</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[events]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">late offset </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> PT30M</span>
            <span class="nv">late handler </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> my-handler %(message)s</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><em>Late offset intervals are not computed automatically so be careful
to update them after any change that affects triggering times.</em></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Cylc can only check for lateness in tasks that it is currently aware
of. If a suite gets delayed over many cycles the next tasks coming up
can be identified as late immediately, and subsequent tasks can be
identified as late as the suite progresses to subsequent cycle points,
until it catches up to the clock.</p>

<h2>Managing External Command Execution<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#managing-external-command-execution" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>Job submission commands, event handlers, and job poll and kill commands, are
executed by the suite server program in a “pool” of asynchronous
subprocesses, in order to avoid holding the suite up. The process pool is
actively managed to limit it to a configurable size
<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/config/global.html#flow.rc|process pool size" title="flow.rc|process pool size"><code class="xref cylc cylc-conf docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">flow.rc|process</span> <span class="pre">pool</span> <span class="pre">size</span></code></a>
Custom event handlers should be light-weight and quick-running because they
will tie up a process pool member until they complete, and the suite will
appear to stall if the pool is saturated with long-running processes. Processes
are killed after a configurable timeout
<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/config/global.html#flow.rc|process pool timeout" title="flow.rc|process pool timeout"><code class="xref cylc cylc-conf docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">flow.rc|process</span> <span class="pre">pool</span> <span class="pre">timeout</span></code></a>

to guard against rogue commands that hang indefinitely. All process kills are
logged by the suite server program. For killed job submissions the associated
tasks also go to the <em>submit-failed</em> state.</p>

<h2>Handling Job Preemption<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#handling-job-preemption" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>Some HPC facilities allow job preemption: the resource manager can kill
or suspend running low priority jobs in order to make way for high
priority jobs. The preempted jobs may then be automatically restarted
by the resource manager, from the same point (if suspended) or requeued
to run again from the start (if killed).</p>
<p>Suspended jobs will poll as still running (their job status file says they
started running, and they still appear in the resource manager queue).
Loadleveler jobs that are preempted by kill-and-requeue (“job vacation”) are
automatically returned to the submitted state by Cylc.  This is possible
because Loadleveler sends the SIGUSR1 signal before SIGKILL for preemption.
Other batch schedulers just send SIGTERM before SIGKILL as normal, so Cylc
cannot distinguish a preemption job kill from a normal job kill. After this the
job will poll as failed (correctly, because it was killed, and the job status
file records that). To handle this kind of preemption automatically you could
use a task failed or retry event handler that queries the batch scheduler queue
(after an appropriate delay if necessary) and then, if the job has been
requeued, uses <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">reset</span></code> to reset the task to the submitted state.</p>

<p>Any task proxy currently present in the suite can be manually triggered at any

If the task belongs to a limited internal queue
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#internalqueues"><span class="std std-ref">Limiting Activity With Internal Queues</span></a>), this will queue it; if not, or if it is already

be used to communicate information to downstream tasks by broadcasting
environment variables (communication of information from one task to
another normally takes place via the filesystem, i.e. the input/output
file relationships embodied in inter-task dependencies). Variables (and
any other runtime settings) may be broadcast to all subsequent tasks,
or targeted specifically at a specific task, all subsequent tasks with a
given name, or all tasks with a given cycle point; see broadcast command help
for details.</p>
<p>Broadcast settings targeted at a specific task ID or cycle point expire and
are forgotten as the suite moves on. Un-targeted variables and those
targeted at a task name persist throughout the suite run, even across
restarts, unless manually cleared using the broadcast command - and so
should be used sparingly.</p>

<p>In the case of a <em>cold start only</em> the initial cycle point is passed
through to task execution environments as

<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$CYLC_SUITE_INITIAL_CYCLE_POINT</span></code> variable allows tasks to
determine if they are running in the initial cold-start cycle point, when
different behaviour may be required, or in a normal mid-run cycle point.

<h2>Automated Reference Test Suites<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#automated-reference-test-suites" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>Reference tests are finite-duration suite runs that abort with non-zero
exit status if any of the following conditions occur (by default):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>cylc fails</li>
<li>any task fails</li>
<li>the suite times out (e.g. a task dies without reporting failure)</li>
<li>a nominated shutdown event handler exits with error status</li>
</ul>
<p>When a reference test suite shuts down, it compares task triggering
information (what triggers off what at run time) in the test run suite
log to that from an earlier reference run, disregarding the timing and
order of events - which can vary according to the external queueing
conditions, runahead limit, and so on.</p>
<p>To prepare a reference log for a suite, run it with the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--reference-log</span></code> option, and manually verify the
correctness of the reference run.</p>
<p>To reference test a suite, just run it (in dummy mode for the most
comprehensive test without running real tasks) with the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--reference-test</span></code> option.</p>
<p>A battery of automated reference tests is used to test cylc before
posting a new release version. Reference tests can also be used to check that
a cylc upgrade will not break your own complex
suites - the triggering check will catch any bug that causes a task to
run when it shouldn’t, for instance; even in a dummy mode reference
test the full task job script (sans <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">script</span></code> items) executes on the
proper task host by the proper batch system.</p>

</div>
<p>For suites owned by others, or those with run databases in non-standard
locations, use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--run-dir</span></code> option, or in-suite:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[runtime]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[my-foo]]</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[suite state polling]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">run-dir </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> /path/to/top/level/cylc/run-directory</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If the remote task has a different cycling sequence, just arrange for the
local polling task to be on the same sequence as the remote task that it
represents. For instance, if local task <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cat</span></code> cycles 6-hourly at
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0,6,12,18</span></code> but needs to trigger off a remote task <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dog</span></code>
at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3,9,15,21</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[graph]]</span>
        <span class="nv">T03,T09,T15,T21 </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> &quot;my-dog&lt;other.suite::dog&gt;&quot;</span>
        <span class="nv">T00,T06,T12,T18 </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> &quot;my-dog[-PT3H] =&gt; cat&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For suite-state polling, the cycle point is automatically converted to the
cycle point format of the target suite.</p>
<p>The remote suite does not have to be running when polling commences because the
command interrogates the suite run database, not the suite server program.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The graph syntax for suite polling tasks cannot be combined with
cycle point offsets, family triggers, or parameterized task notation.
This does not present a problem because suite polling tasks can be put on
the same cycling sequence as the remote-suite target task (as recommended
above), and there is no point in having multiple tasks (family members or
parameterized tasks) performing the same polling operation. Task state
triggers can be used with suite polling, e.g. to trigger another task if
polling fails after 10 tries at 10 second intervals:</p>

<h2>Suite Server Logs<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#suite-server-logs" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>Each suite maintains its own log of time-stamped events under the <em>suite

<p>By way of example, we will show the complete server log generated (at
cylc-7.2.0) by a small suite that runs two 30-second dummy tasks
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bar</span></code> for a single cycle point
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2017-01-01T00Z</span></code> before shutting down:</p>

<p>By the task scripting defined above, this suite will stall when <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code>
fails. Then, the suite owner <em>vagrant&#64;cylon</em> manually resets the failed
task’s state to <em>succeeded</em>, allowing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bar</span></code> to trigger and the
suite to finish and shut down.  Here’s the complete suite log for this run:</p>

<h2>Suite Run Databases<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#suite-run-databases" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>Suite server programs maintain two <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sqlite</span></code> databases to record
restart checkpoints and various other aspects of run history:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/cylc-run/SUITE-NAME/log/db  <span class="c1"># public suite DB</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The private DB is for use only by the suite server program. The identical
public DB is provided for use by external commands such as
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">suite-state</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">ls-checkpoints</span></code>, and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">report-timings</span></code>. If the public DB gets locked for too long by
an external reader, the suite server program will eventually delete it and
replace it with a new copy of the private DB, to ensure that both correctly
reflect the suite state.</p>
<p>You can interrogate the public DB with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sqlite3</span></code> command line tool,
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sqlite3</span></code> module in the Python standard library, or any other

<h2>Disaster Recovery<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#disaster-recovery" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>If a suite run directory gets deleted or corrupted, the options for recovery
are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>restore the run directory from back-up, and restart the suite</li>
<li>re-install from source, and warm start from the beginning of the
current cycle point</li>
</ul>
<p>A warm start (see <a class="reference internal" href="#warm-start"><span class="std std-ref">Warm Start</span></a>) does not need a suite state
checkpoint, but it wipes out prior run history, and it could re-run
a significant number of tasks that had already completed.</p>
<p>To restart the suite, the critical Cylc files that must be restored are:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># On the suite host:</span>
~/cylc-run/SUITE-NAME/
    suite.rc   <span class="c1"># live suite configuration (located here in Rose suites)</span>
    log/db  <span class="c1"># public suite DB (can just be a copy of the private DB)</span>
    log/rose-suite-run.conf  <span class="c1"># (needed to restart a Rose suite)</span>
    .service/db  <span class="c1"># private suite DB</span>
    .service/source -&gt; PATH-TO-SUITE-DIR  <span class="c1"># symlink to live suite directory</span>

<span class="c1"># On job hosts (if no shared filesystem):</span>
~/cylc-run/SUITE-NAME/
    log/job/CYCLE-POINT/TASK-NAME/SUBMIT-NUM/job.status
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This discussion does not address restoration of files generated and
consumed by task jobs at run time. How suite data is stored and recovered
in your environment is a matter of suite and system design.</p>
</div>
<p>In short, you can simply restore the suite service directory, the log
directory, and the suite.rc file that is the target of the symlink in the
service directory. The service and log directories will come with extra files
that aren’t strictly needed for a restart, but that doesn’t matter - although
depending on your log housekeeping the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">log/job</span></code> directory could be
huge, so you might want to be selective about that.  (Also in a Rose suite, the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">suite.rc</span></code> file does not need to be restored if you restart with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rose</span> <span class="pre">suite-run</span></code> - which re-installs suite source files to the run
directory).</p>
<p>The public DB is not strictly required for a restart - the suite server program
will recreate it if need be - but it is required by
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">ls-checkpoints</span></code> if you need to identify the right restart
checkpoint.</p>
<p>The job status files are only needed if the restart suite state checkpoint
contains active tasks that need to be polled to determine what happened to them
while the suite was down.  Without them, polling will fail and those tasks will
need to be manually set to the correct state.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">It is not safe to copy or rsync a potentially-active sqlite DB - the copy
might end up corrupted. It is best to stop the suite before copying
a DB, or else write a back-up utility using the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.sqlite.org/backup.html">official sqlite backup API</a>.</p>

<h2>Auto Stop-Restart<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#auto-stop-restart" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>Cylc has the ability to automatically stop suites running on a particular host
and optionally, restart them on a different host.
This is useful if a host needs to be taken off-line e.g. for
scheduled maintenance.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference internal" href="plugins/main-loop/built-in/cylc.flow.main_loop.auto_restart.html#module-cylc.flow.main_loop.auto_restart" title="cylc.flow.main_loop.auto_restart"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc.flow.main_loop.auto_restart</span></code></a> for details.</p>

<h2>Alternate Run Directories<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#alternate-run-directories" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">register</span></code> command normally creates a run directory at
the standard location <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/cylc-run/&lt;WORKFLOW-NAME&gt;/</span></code>. With the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--run-dir</span></code>
option it can create the run directory at some other location, with a symlink
from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/cylc-run/&lt;WORKFLOW-NAME&gt;</span></code> to allow access via the standard file path.</p>
<p>This may be useful for quick-running <a class="reference internal" href="#sub-workflows"><span class="std std-ref">Sub-Workflows</span></a> that generate large
numbers of files - you could put their run directories on fast local disk or
RAM disk, for performance and housekeeping reasons.</p>

<article class="slide level-2" id="sub-workflows">

<h2>Sub-Workflows<a class="headerlink" href="../../html/user-guide/running-suites.html#sub-workflows" title="View HTML">§</a></h2>

<p>A single Cylc workflow can configure multiple cycling sequences in the graph,
but cycles can’t be nested. If you need <em>cycles within cycles</em> - e.g. to
iterate over many files generated by each run of a cycling task - current
options are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>parameterize the sub-cycles<ul>
<li>this is easy but it makes more tasks-per-cycle, which is the primary
determinant of workflow size and server program efficiency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>run a separate cycling workflow over the sub-cycle, inside a main-workflow
task, for each main-workflow cycle point - i.e. use <strong>sub-workflows</strong><ul>
<li>this is very efficient, but monitoring and run-directory housekeeping may
be more difficult because it creates multiple workflows and run directories</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sub-workflows must be started with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--no-detach</span></code> so that the containing task
does not finish until the sub-workflow does, and they should be non-cycling
or have a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">final</span> <span class="pre">cycle</span> <span class="pre">point</span></code> so they don’t keep on running indefinitely.</p>
<p>Sub-workflow names should normally incorporate the main-workflow cycle point (use
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_POINT</span></code> in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">run</span></code> command line to start the
sub-workflow), so that successive sub-workflows can run concurrently if necessary and
do not compete for the same run directory. This will generate a new sub-workflow
run directory for every main-workflow cycle point, so you may want to put
housekeeping tasks in the main workflow to extract the useful products from each
sub-workflow run and then delete the sub-workflow run directory.</p>
<p>For quick-running sub-workflows that generate large numbers of files, consider
using <a class="reference internal" href="#alternate-run-directories"><span class="std std-ref">Alternate Run Directories</span></a> for better performance and easier housekeeping.</p>

<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id8">[3]</a></td><td>Late notification of clock-triggered tasks is not very useful in
