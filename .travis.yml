# Configuration for the Travis continuous integration system
# ==========================================================
# 
# Travis is a free service for running automatic tests on Github repositories.
# This file configures Travis for Cylc, telling it how to install Cylc and run
# the test battery.
# 
# Test results get posted back to Github. By default Travis will run tests on any
# pull requests, adding a comment on the pull request page to say if the tests
# pass or fail, it will also test any new commits, showing the test results on
# the branch page, e.g. https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/branches.
# 
# Connecting a Cylc branch
# ------------------------
# 
# To make use of Travis you will first need to create a fork of Cylc in Github.
# Log in to https://travis-ci.org using your Github credentials, it will ask for
# permission to see your repositories, set the status of branches (whether the
# build passes or fails tests) and create hooks so Travis gets notified of new
# commits.
# 
# Travis will create a list of all of your public Github repositories, you can
# enable automatic tests for a repository using the switches in this list.
# 
# More information for Travis can be found at http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/
