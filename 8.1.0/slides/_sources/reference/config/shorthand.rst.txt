We often use a compact single-line notation to refer to nested config items:

``[section]``
   An entire section.
``[section]setting``
   A setting within a section.
``[section]setting=value``
   The value of a setting within a section.
``[section][sub-section]another-setting``
   A setting within a sub-section.

In the file, however, section headings need additional brackets at each level.
