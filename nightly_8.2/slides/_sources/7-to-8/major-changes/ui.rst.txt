Cylc 8 UIs
==========

There are two UI options available to monitor and control workflows at Cylc 8.


Cylc TUI
--------

Cylc TUI is a text based UI, available on the command line with
``cylc tui <workflow_id>``.

It remains in development, with smooth running with large workflows soon to be
resolved.

This replaces Cylc 7's ``cylc monitor``.


Cylc Web GUI
------------

Cylc 8 web GUI is available, both as a single user application, ``cylc gui``
and as a multi user hub, ``cylc hub``. Both are dependent on `Cylc UI Server`_ installation.

Launching the UI via the hub will require authentication.
The default Authenticator uses PAM to authenticate system users with their
username and password.
Going via the hub unlocks the :ref:`Authorization` feature.

See :ref:`UI_Server_config` for how to configure the GUI.

As some workflows can be very large, or even infinite, the UI uses a "window"
system to determine what to display. For more information, see :ref:`n-window`.

The UI continues to be developed.

.. TODO Possibly add more screen-grabs/information here.
