Suite Storage, Discovery, Revision Control, and Deployment
==========================================================

Cylc does not have a built-in solution for suite storage and discovery,
revision control, and deployment, on a network.

Version control is not Cylc's core purpose, and projects may have their own
preferences and suite meta-data requirements that are difficult to anticipate.
We can, however, recommend the use of the Rosie system which comes as a part of
*Rose* to do all of this very easily and elegantly with Cylc suites.
