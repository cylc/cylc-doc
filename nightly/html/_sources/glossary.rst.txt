   cylc workflow
      A Cylc workflow is a collection of :term:`tasks <task>` to carry out and
      :term:`dependencies <dependency>` that govern the order in which they
      run. This is represented in Cylc format in a :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc` file.

      For example here is a Cylc workflow representing the brewing process:

      .. code-block:: cylc
         :caption: flow.cylc

         [scheduling]
             cycling mode = integer
             initial cycle point = 1
             [[graph]]
                 # repeat this for each batch
                 P1 = """
                     # the stages of brewing in the order they must occur in
                     malt => mash => sparge => boil => chill => ferment => rack

                     # must finish the sparge of one batch before
                     # starting the next one
                     # sparge[-P1] => mash
                 """

      .. admonition:: Cylc 7
         :class: tip

         In Cylc version 7 and earlier "workflows" were referred to as
         "suites".

   graph
      The graph of a :term:`workflow<Cylc workflow>` refers to the
      :term:`graph strings<graph string>` contained within the
      :cylc:conf:`[scheduling][graph]` section. For example the following is,
      collectively, a graph:

      .. code-block:: cylc

         P1D = foo => bar
         PT12H = baz

      .. digraph:: example
         :align: center

         size = "7,15"

         subgraph cluster_1 {
             label = "2000-01-01T00:00Z"
             style = dashed
             "foo.01T00" [label="foo\n2000-01-01T00:00Z"]
             "bar.01T00" [label="bar\n2000-01-01T00:00Z"]
             "baz.01T00" [label="baz\n2000-01-01T00:00Z"]
         }

         subgraph cluster_2 {
             label = "2000-01-01T12:00Z"
             style = dashed
             "baz.01T12" [label="baz\n2000-01-01T12:00Z"]
         }

         subgraph cluster_3 {
             label = "2000-01-02T00:00Z"
             style = dashed
             "foo.02T00" [label="foo\n2000-01-02T00:00Z"]
             "bar.02T00" [label="bar\n2000-01-02T00:00Z"]
             "baz.02T00" [label="baz\n2000-01-02T00:00Z"]
         }

         "foo.01T00" -> "bar.01T00"
         "foo.02T00" -> "bar.02T00"

   graph string
      A graph string is a collection of dependencies which are placed inside the
      :cylc:conf:`[scheduling][graph]` section e.g:

      .. code-block:: cylc-graph

         foo => bar => baz & pub => qux
         pub => bool

   dependency
      A dependency is a relationship between two :term:`tasks<task>` which
      describes a constraint on one.

      For example the dependency
      ``foo => bar`` means that the :term:`task` ``bar`` is *dependent* on the
      task ``foo``. This means that the task ``bar`` will only run once the
      task ``foo`` has successfully completed.

      See also:

      * :term:`task trigger`
      * :term:`conditional dependency`

   conditional dependency
   conditional trigger
      A conditional dependency is a :term:`dependency` which uses the ``&`` (and)
      or ``|`` (or) operators for example:

      .. code-block:: cylc-graph

         a & (b | c) => d

      See also:

      * :term:`dependency`
      * :term:`task trigger`

   trigger
   task trigger
      :term:`Dependency <dependency>` relationships can be thought of the other
      way around as "triggers".

      For example the dependency ``foo => bar`` could be described in several ways:

      * "``bar`` depends on ``foo``"
      * "``foo`` triggers ``bar``"
      * "``bar`` triggers off of ``foo``"

      In practice a trigger is the left-hand side of a dependency (``foo`` in
      this example).

      See also:

      * :term:`dependency`
      * :term:`qualifier`
      * :term:`family trigger`

   cycle
      In a :term:`cycling workflow<cycling>` one cycle is one repetition of the
      workflow.

      For example, in the following workflow each dotted box represents a cycle
      and the :term:`tasks<task>` within it are the :term:`tasks<task>`
      belonging to that cycle. The numbers (i.e. ``1``, ``2``, ``3``) are the
      :term:`cycle points<cycle point>`.

      .. digraph:: example
         :align: center

         size = "3,5"

         subgraph cluster_1 {
             label = "1"
             style = dashed
             "foo.1" [label="foo\n1"]
             "bar.1" [label="bar\n1"]
             "baz.1" [label="baz\n1"]
         }

         subgraph cluster_2 {
             label = "2"
             style = dashed
             "foo.2" [label="foo\n2"]
             "bar.2" [label="bar\n2"]
             "baz.2" [label="baz\n2"]
         }

         subgraph cluster_3 {
             label = "3"
             style = dashed
             "foo.3" [label="foo\n3"]
             "bar.3" [label="bar\n3"]
             "baz.3" [label="baz\n3"]
         }

         "foo.1" -> "bar.1" -> "baz.1"
         "foo.2" -> "bar.2" -> "baz.2"
         "foo.3" -> "bar.3" -> "baz.3"
         "bar.1" -> "bar.2" -> "bar.3"

   cycling
      A cycling :term:`workflow<Cylc workflow>` is one in which the workflow repeats.

      See also:

      * :term:`cycle`
      * :term:`cycle point`

   cycle point
      A cycle point is the unique label given to a particular :term:`cycle`.
      If the :term:`workflow<Cylc workflow>` is using :term:`integer cycling` then
      the cycle points will be numbers e.g. ``1``, ``2``, ``3``, etc. If the
      :term:`workflow<Cylc workflow>` is using :term:`datetime cycling` then the
      labels will be :term:`ISO8601` datetimes e.g. ``2000-01-01T00:00Z``.

      See also:

      * :term:`initial cycle point`
      * :term:`final cycle point`

   initial cycle point
      In a :term:`cycling workflow <cycling>` the initial cycle point is the point
      from which cycling begins.

      It is set by :cylc:conf:`[scheduling]initial cycle point`.

      If the initial cycle point were 2000 then the first cycle would
      be on the 1st of January 2000.

      See also:

      * :term:`cycle point`
      * :term:`final cycle point`

   final cycle point
      In a :term:`cycling workflow <cycling>` the final cycle point is the point
      at which cycling ends.

      It is set by :cylc:conf:`[scheduling]final cycle point`.

      If the final cycle point were 2001 then the final cycle would be no later
      than the 1st of January 2001.

      See also:

      * :term:`cycle point`
      * :term:`initial cycle point`

   start cycle point
      The start cycle point is the :term:`cycle point` where the
      :term:`scheduler` :term:`starts <start>` running from.

      This may be before or after the :term:`initial cycle point`.

      See :ref:`start_stop_cycle_point` for more information.

      See also:

      * :ref:`start_stop_cycle_point`
      * :term:`cycle point`
      * :term:`stop cycle point`
      * :term:`initial cycle point`

   stop cycle point
      The stop cycle point is the :term:`cycle point` at which the
      :term:`scheduler` :term:`shuts down <shutdown>`.

      This may be before or after the :term:`final cycle point`.

      See :ref:`start_stop_cycle_point` for more information.

      See also:

      * :ref:`start_stop_cycle_point`
      * :term:`cycle point`
      * :term:`start cycle point`
      * :term:`final cycle point`

   integer cycling
      An integer cycling workflow is a :term:`cycling workflow<cycling>` which has
      been configured to use integer cycling. When a workflow uses integer cycling
      integer :term:`recurrences <recurrence>` may be used in the :term:`graph`,
      e.g. ``P3`` means every third cycle. This is configured by setting
      :cylc:conf:`[scheduling]cycling mode = integer`.

      See also:

      * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-integer-cycling>`

   datetime cycling
      A datetime cycling is the default for a :term:`cycling workflow<cycling>`.
      When using datetime cycling :term:`cycle points<cycle point>` will be
      :term:`ISO8601 datetimes <ISO8601 datetime>` e.g. ``2000-01-01T00:00Z``
      and ISO8601 :term:`recurrences<recurrence>` can be used e.g. ``P3D``
      means every third day.

      See also:

      * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-datetime-cycling>`

   wall-clock time
      In a Cylc workflow the wall-clock time refers to the actual time (in the
      real world).

      See also:

      * :term:`datetime cycling`
      * :ref:`Clock Trigger Tutorial <tutorial-cylc-clock-trigger>`

   ISO8601
      ISO8601 is an international standard for writing dates and times which is
      used in Cylc with :term:`datetime cycling`.

      See also:

      * :term:`ISO8601 datetime`
      * :term:`recurrence`
      * `Wikipedia (ISO8601) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_

      * `a summary of the international standard date and time notation
        <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Emgk25/iso-time.html>`_

   ISO8601 datetime
      A date-time written in the ISO8601
      format, e.g:

      * ``2000-01-01T00:00Z``: midnight on the 1st of January 2000

      See also:

      * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-iso8601-datetimes>`
      * :term:`ISO8601`

   ISO8601 duration
      A duration written in the ISO8601 format e.g:

      * ``PT1H30M``: one hour and thirty minutes.

      See also:

      * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-iso8601-durations>`
      * :term:`ISO8601`

   recurrence
      A recurrence is a repeating sequence which may be used to define a
      :term:`cycling workflow<cycling>`. Recurrences determine how often something
      repeats and take one of two forms depending on whether the
      :term:`workflow<Cylc workflow>` is configured to use :term:`integer cycling`
      or :term:`datetime cycling`.

      See also:

      * :term:`integer cycling`
      * :term:`datetime cycling`

   inter-cycle dependency
   inter-cycle trigger
      In a :term:`cycling workflow <cycling>` an inter-cycle dependency
      is a :term:`dependency` between two tasks in different cycles.

      For example in the following workflow the task ``bar`` is dependent on
      its previous occurrence:

      .. code-block:: cylc

         [scheduling]
             initial cycle point = 1
             cycling mode = integer
             [[graph]]
                 P1 = """
                     foo => bar => baz
                     bar[-P1] => bar
                 """

      .. digraph:: example
         :align: center

         size = "3,5"

         subgraph cluster_1 {
             label = "1"
             style = dashed
             "foo.1" [label="foo\n1"]
             "bar.1" [label="bar\n1"]
             "baz.1" [label="baz\n1"]
         }

         subgraph cluster_2 {
             label = "2"
             style = dashed
             "foo.2" [label="foo\n2"]
             "bar.2" [label="bar\n2"]
             "baz.2" [label="baz\n2"]
         }

         subgraph cluster_3 {
             label = "3"
             style = dashed
             "foo.3" [label="foo\n3"]
             "bar.3" [label="bar\n3"]
             "baz.3" [label="baz\n3"]
         }

         "foo.1" -> "bar.1" -> "baz.1"
         "foo.2" -> "bar.2" -> "baz.2"
         "foo.3" -> "bar.3" -> "baz.3"
         "bar.1" -> "bar.2" -> "bar.3"

   qualifier
      A qualifier is used to determine the :term:`task state` to which a
      :term:`dependency` relates.

      See also:

      * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-qualifiers>`
      * :term:`task state`

   task
      A task represents an activity in a workflow. It is a specification of
      that activity consisting of the script or executable to run and certain
      details of the environment it is run in.

      The task specification is used to create a :term:`job` which is executed
      on behalf of the task.

      Tasks submit :term:`jobs <job>` and therefore each :term:`job` belongs
      to one task. Each task can submit multiple :term:`jobs <job>`.

      See also:

      * :term:`job`
      * :term:`job script`

   task state
      During a :term:`task's <task>` life it will proceed through various
      states. These include:

      * waiting
      * running
      * succeeded

      See also:

      * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-tasks-and-jobs>`
      * :term:`task`
      * :term:`job`
      * :term:`qualifier`

   implicit task
      An implicit task (previously known as a naked task) is a task in the
      graph that does not have an explicit runtime definition.
      For example, ``bar`` is an implicit task in the following workflow:

      .. code-block:: cylc

         [scheduling]
             [[graph]]
                 R1 = foo & bar
         [runtime]
             [[foo]]

      Implicit tasks are not allowed by default, as they are often typos.
      However, it is possible to allow them using
      :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc[scheduler]allow implicit tasks` during
      development of a workflow.

      See also:

      * :ref:`ImplicitTasks`

   work directory
      When Cylc executes a :term:`job` it does so inside the
      :term:`job's <job>` working directory. This directory is created by Cylc
      and lies within the directory tree inside the relevant workflow's
      :term:`run directory`.

      .. code-block:: sub

         <run directory>/work/<cycle>/<task-name>

      The location of the work directory can be accessed by a :term:`job` via
      the environment variable ``CYLC_TASK_WORK_DIR``.

      See also:

      * :term:`run directory`
      * :term:`share directory`

   share directory
      The share directory resides within a workflow's
      :term:`run directory`. It serves the purpose of providing a
      storage place for any files which need to be shared between different
      tasks.

      .. code-block:: sub

         <run directory>/share

      The location of the share directory can be accessed by a :term:`job` via
      the environment variable ``CYLC_WORKFLOW_SHARE_DIR``.

      In cycling workflows files are typically stored in cycle sub-directories.

      See also:

      * :term:`run directory`
      * :term:`work directory`

   workflow log
   workflow log directory
      A Cylc workflow logs events and other information to the workflow log files
      when it runs. There are two log files:

      * ``log`` - a log of workflow events, consisting of information about
        user interaction.
      * ``file-installation-log`` - a log documenting the file installation
        process on remote platforms.

      The workflow log directory lies within the :term:`run directory`:

      .. code-block:: sub

         <run directory>/log/workflow

   job log
   job log directory
      When Cylc executes a :term:`job`, stdout and stderr are redirected to the
      ``job.out`` and ``job.err`` files which are stored in the job log
      directory.

      The job log directory lies within the :term:`run directory`:

      .. code-block:: sub

         <run directory>/log/job/<cycle>/<task-name>/<submission-no>

      Other files stored in the job log directory:

      * ``job``: the :term:`job script`.
      * ``job-activity.log``: a log file containing details of the
        :term:`job's <job>` progress.
      * ``job.status``: a file holding Cylc's most up-to-date
        understanding of the :term:`job's <job>` present status.

   service directory
      This directory is used to store information for internal use by Cylc.

      It is called ``.service`` and is located in the
      :term:`run directory`, it should exist for all installed
      workflows.

   contact file
      The contact file records information about a running workflow such as the
      host it is running on, the TCP port(s) it is listening on and the process
      ID. The file is called ``contact`` and lives inside the workflow's
      :term:`service directory`.

      The contact file only exists when the workflow is running, if you delete
      the contact file, the workflow will (after a delay) notice this and shut
      down.

      .. warning::

         In the event that a workflow process dies in an uncontrolled way, for
         example if the process is killed or the host which is running the
         process crashes, the contact file may be erroneously left behind. Some
         Cylc commands will automatically detect such files and remove them,
         otherwise they should be manually removed.

   job
      A job is the realisation of a :term:`task` consisting of a file called
      the :term:`job script` which is executed when the job "runs".

      See also:

      * :term:`task`
      * :term:`job script`

   job script
      A job script is the file containing a bash script which is executed when
      a :term:`job` runs. A task's job script can be found in the
      :term:`job log directory`.

      See also:

      * :term:`task`
      * :term:`job`
      * :term:`job submission number`

   job host
      The job host is the compute resource that a :term:`job` runs on. For
      example ``node_1`` would be one of two possible job hosts on the
      :term:`platform` ``my_hpc`` for the task ``some-task`` in the
      following workflow:

      .. code-block:: cylc
         :caption: global.cylc

         [platforms]
             [[my_hpc]]
                 hosts = node_1, node_2
                 job runner = slurm

      .. code-block:: cylc
         :caption: flow.cylc

         [runtime]
             [[some-task]]
                 platform = my_hpc

      See also:

      * :term:`platform`

   job submission number
      Cylc may run multiple :term:`jobs <job>` per :term:`task` (e.g. if the
      task failed and was re-tried). Each time Cylc runs a :term:`job` it is
      assigned a submission number. The submission number starts at 1,
      incrementing with each submission.

      See also:

      * :term:`job`
      * :term:`job script`

   job runner
   batch system
      A job runner (also known as batch system or job scheduler) is a system
      for submitting :term:`jobs <job>` to a :term:`job platform <platform>`.

      Job runners are set on a per-platform basis in
      :cylc:conf:`global.cylc[platforms][<platform name>]job runner`.

      See also:

      * `Wikipedia (job scheduler)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_scheduler>`_
      * :term:`directive`

   directive
      Directives are used by :term:`job runners <job runner>` to determine
      what a :term:`job's <job>` requirements are, e.g. how much memory

      * :term:`job runner`

   platform
   job platform
      A configured setup for running :term:`jobs <job>` on (usually remotely).
      Platforms are primarily defined by the combination of a
      :term:`job runner` and a group of :term:`hosts <job host>`
      (which share a file system).

      For example ``my_hpc`` could be the platform for the task ``some-task``
      in the following workflow:

      .. code-block:: cylc
         :caption: Global configuration (``global.cylc``)

         [platforms]
             [[my_hpc]]

   scheduler
      When we say that a :term:`workflow` is "running" we mean that the cylc
      scheduler is running.

      The scheduler is responsible for running the workflow. It submits
      :term:`jobs <job>`, monitors their status and maintains the workflow state.

      .. _daemon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)

      By default a scheduler is a `daemon`_ meaning that it runs in
      the background (potentially on another host).

   start
   startup
      A start is when the Cylc :term:`scheduler` runs a :term:`workflow`
      for the first time. The scheduler is the program that
      controls the workflow and is what we refer to as "running".

      A workflow start can be either :term:`cold <cold start>` or
      :term:`warm <warm start>` (cold by default).

      * :term:`restart`
      * :term:`reload`

   cold start
      A cold start is one in which the :term:`workflow` :term:`starts <start>`
      from the :term:`initial cycle point`. This is the default behaviour
      of ``cylc play`` for a workflow that hasn't been run before.

      See also:

      * :term:`start`
      * :term:`warm start`

   warm start
      In a :term:`cycling workflow <cycling>`, a warm start
      is one in which a :term:`workflow` (that hasn't been run before)
      :term:`starts <start>` from a :term:`start cycle point` that is after the
      :term:`initial cycle point`. Tasks in cycles before this point are
      treated as if they have succeeded.

   cylc-run directory
      The directory that contains workflows. This is, by default, ``~/cylc-run``
      but may be configured using :cylc:conf:`global.cylc[symlink dirs]`.

      See also:

      * :term:`run directory`

   source directory
      Any directory where :term:`workflows <workflow>` are written and stored
      in preparation for installation with ``cylc install`` or reinstallation
      with ``cylc reinstall``.

      .. tip::

         You can configure the default locations where the ``cylc install``
         will look for source directories using the
         :cylc:conf:`global.cylc[install]source dirs` configuration.

      See also:

      * :term:`run directory`
      * :ref:`Installing-workflows`

   run directory
      This is a directory containing the configuration that Cylc uses to run
      the :term:`workflow`.

      Typically this is installed from the :term:`source directory` using
      ``cylc install``.

      The run directory can be accessed by a running workflow using
      the environment variable ``CYLC_WORKFLOW_RUN_DIR``.

   play
      We run a :term:`workflow` using the ``cylc play`` command.

      This starts a :term:`scheduler` which is the program that controls the
      flow and is what we refer to as "running".

      You can :term:`play`, :term:`pause` and :term:`stop` a :term:`flow`,
      Cylc will always carry on where it left off.

      See also:

      * :term:`pause`
      * :term:`stop`

   pause
      When a :term:`workflow` is "paused" the :term:`scheduler` is still
      running, however, will not submit any new jobs.

      This can be useful if you want to make a change to a running workflow.

      Pause a workflow using ``cylc pause`` and resume it using ``cylc play``.

      See also:

      * :term:`play`
      * :term:`stop`
      * :term:`hold`

   stop
   shutdown
      When a :term:`workflow` is shut down the :term:`scheduler` is
      stopped. This means that no further :term:`jobs <job>` will be submitted.

      By default Cylc waits for any submitted or running :term:`jobs <job>` to
      complete (either succeed or fail) before shutting down.

   restart
      When a :term:`stopped <stop>` :term:`workflow` is restarted, Cylc will pick
      up where it left off. Cylc will detect any :term:`jobs <job>` which
      have changed state (e.g. succeeded) during the period in which the
      :term:`workflow` was stopped.

      A restart is the behaviour of ``cylc play`` for a workflow that has been
      previously run.

   reload
      Any changes made to the :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc` file whilst the workflow is
      running will not have any effect until the workflow is either:

      * :term:`Shutdown <shutdown>` and :term:`rerun <start>`
      * :term:`Shutdown <shutdown>` and :term:`restarted <restart>`
      * "Reloaded"

      Reloading does not require the workflow to be :term:`shutdown`. When a workflow
      is reloaded any currently "active" :term:`tasks <task>` will continue with
      their "pre-reload" configuration, whilst new tasks will use the new
      configuration.

      Reloading changes is safe providing they don't affect the
      :term:`workflow's <workflow>` :term:`graph`. Changes to the graph have certain
      caveats attached, see the `Cylc User Guide`_ for details.

   hold
   held task
   hold after cycle point
      A :term:`task` can be held using ``cylc hold``, which prevents it from
      submitting :term:`jobs <job>`. Both active tasks (n=0) and future tasks
      (n>0) can be held; the latter will be immediately held when they spawn.

      It is also possible to set a "hold after cycle point"; all tasks after
      this cycle point will be held.

      .. note::

         :term:`Workflows <workflow>` can be :term:`paused <pause>` and
         unpaused/resumed.

         :term:`Tasks <task>` can be :term:`held <hold>` and
         :term:`released <release>`.

         When a workflow is unpaused any held tasks remain held.

      See also:

      * :term:`release`

   release
      :term:`Held tasks <hold>` can be released using ``cylc release``,
      allowing submission of :term:`jobs <job>` once again.

      It is also possible to remove the "hold after cycle point" if set,
      using ``cylc release --all``. This will also release all held tasks.

      See also:

      * :term:`hold`

   parameterisation
      Parameterisation is a way to consolidate configuration in the Cylc
      :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc` file by implicitly looping over a set of
      pre-defined variables e.g:

      .. code-block:: cylc

         [scheduler]
             [[parameters]]
                 foo = 1..3
         [scheduling]
             [[graph]]
                 R1 = bar<foo> => baz<foo>

      .. minicylc::
         :theme: none

         bar_foo1 => baz_foo1
         bar_foo2 => baz_foo2
         bar_foo3 => baz_foo3

      * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-cylc-parameterisation>`

   family
      In Cylc a family is a collection of :term:`tasks <task>` which share a
      common configuration and which can be referred to collectively in the
      :term:`graph`.

      By convention families are named in upper case with the exception of the
      special ``root`` family from which all tasks inherit.

      See also:

      * :ref:`Cylc tutorial <tutorial-cylc-families>`
      * :term:`family inheritance`
      * :term:`family trigger`

   family inheritance
      A :term:`task` can be "added" to a :term:`family` by "inheriting" from
      it using the :cylc:conf:`[runtime][<namespace>]inherit` configuration.

      For example the :term:`task` ``task`` "belongs" to the :term:`family`
      ``FAMILY`` in the following snippet:

      .. code-block:: cylc

         [runtime]
             [[FAMILY]]
                 [[[environment]]]
                     FOO = foo
             [[task]]
                 inherit = FAMILY

      A task can inherit from multiple families by writing a comma-separated
      list e.g:

      .. code-block:: cylc

         inherit = foo, bar, baz

      See also:

      * `Cylc User Guide`_
      * :term:`family`
      * :term:`family trigger`

   family trigger
      :term:`Tasks <task>` which "belong" to
      (:term:`inherit <family inheritance>` from) a :term:`family` can be
      referred to collectively in the :term:`graph` using a family trigger.

      A family trigger is written using the name of the family followed by a
      special qualifier i.e. ``FAMILY_NAME:qualifier``. The most commonly used
      qualifiers are:

      ``succeed-all``
          The dependency will only be met when **all** of the tasks in the
          family have **succeeded**.
      ``succeed-any``
          The dependency will be met as soon as **any one** of the tasks in the
          family has **succeeded**.
      ``finish-all``
          The dependency will only be met once **all** of the tasks in the
          family have **finished** (either succeeded or failed).

      * :term:`family`
      * :term:`task trigger`
      * :term:`dependency`
      * :ref:`Family Trigger Tutorial <tutorial-cylc-family-triggers>`

   message trigger
      A `message trigger` can be used to trigger a dependent
      :term:`task <task>` before the upstream task has completed.

      We can use :term:`custom task outputs <custom task output>` as triggers.

      Messages should be defined in the runtime section of the workflow and
      the graph trigger notation refers to each message.

      See also:

      * :ref:`Message Trigger Tutorial <tutorial-cylc-message-triggers>`
      * :term:`custom task output`

   custom task output
      A `custom task output` is a user-defined message sent from the
      :term:`job` to the workflow server.
      These can be used as :term:`message triggers <message trigger>`.

      See also:

      * `Cylc User Guide`_
      * :term:`message trigger`

   stalled workflow
   stalled state
      If Cylc is unable to proceed running a workflow due to unmet dependencies
      the workflow is said to be *stalled*.

      This usually happens because of a task failure as in the following
      diagram:

      .. digraph:: Example
         :align: center

         foo [style="filled" color="#ada5a5"]
         bar [style="filled" color="#ff0000" fontcolor="white"]
         baz [color="#88c6ff"]

         foo -> bar -> baz

      In this example the task ``bar`` has failed meaning that ``baz`` is
      unable to run as its dependency (``bar:succeed``) has not been met.

      When a Cylc detects that a workflow has stalled an email will be sent to the
      user. Human interaction is required to escape a stalled state.

   suicide trigger
      Suicide triggers remove :term:`tasks <task>` from the :term:`graph`.

      This allows Cylc to dynamically alter the graph based on events in the
      workflow.

      .. warning::

         Since Cylc 8 suicide triggers have been surpassed by
         :term:`graph branching` which provides a simpler, superior
         solution.

      Suicide triggers are denoted using an exclamation mark, ``!foo`` would
      mean "remove the task foo from this cycle".

      .. code-block:: cylc-graph

         a => b

         # suicide trigger which removes the task "b" if "a" fails
         # NOTE: since Cylc 8 this suicide trigger is not necessary
         a:fail => !b

   branching
   graph branching
      Cylc handles :term:`graphs <graph>` in an event-driven manner which means
      that a workflow can follow different paths in different eventualities.
      This is called "branching".

      For example the following workflow follows one of two possible paths
      depending on the outcome of task ``b``:

      .. digraph:: example
         :align: center

         subgraph cluster_success {
            label = ":succeed"
            color = "green"
            fontcolor = "green"
            style = "dashed"

            c
         }

         subgraph cluster_failure {
            label = ":fail"
            color = "red"
            fontcolor = "red"
            style = "dashed"

            r
         }

         a -> b -> c -> d
         b -> r -> d

      See also:

      * :ref:`Graph Branching`

   .. TODO - add this after the universal ID work

      workflow id
         A workflow ID is the name Cylc uses to identify a :term:`workflow` in
         the :term:`run directory`.

         This ID is used on the command line and in the GUI.

         The ID is the relative path between the :term:`workflows <workflow>`
         :term:`run directory` and the :term:`cylc run directory`.

         For example, if your workflow is in ``~/cylc-run/foo/bar/run1`` then its ID
         is ``foo/bar/run1``.

         .. ..note:: For convenience you can omit the ``/run1`` on the command line.

   flow
      A flow is a single logical run of a :term:`workflow` that is done by
      a :term:`scheduler`.

      A flow can be :term:`played <play>` and :term:`paused <pause>`,
      :term:`stopped <stop>` and :term:`restarted <restart>`.

      A flow begins at the :term:`start cycle point` and ends at the
      :term:`stop cycle point`.

      It is possible to run more than one flow in a single :term:`scheduler`.

   reflow
      A reflow is a subsequent logical run of a :term:`workflow` that is done by
      the same :term:`scheduler` as the original :term:`flow`.

      Reflows are useful when you need to re-wind your :term:`workflow` run to
      allow it to evolve a new path into the future.

      .. TODO - add this once the CLI example works

         For example, the following workflow runs the task ``a`` every cycle, then
         either ``b`` or ``c`` depending on the outcome of ``a``:

         .. code-block:: cylc

            [scheduler]
                allow implicit tasks = True

            [scheduling]
                cycling mode = integer
                initial cycle point = 1
                [[graph]]
                    P1 = """
                        b[-P1] | c[-P1] => a
                        a:succeed => b
                        a:fail => c
                    """

         Let's say the workflow has run to cycle 8, but we have just noticed that
         something went wrong with the task ``a`` in cycle 5.

         To rectify this we could create a new flow (a reflow) starting at ``a.5``::

            # get the ID of the original flow
            cylc TBC <id> a.5  # ???

            # pause the original flow
            cylc pause <id> --flow <flow>

            # create a new flow starting at a.5
            cylc trigger a.5 --reflow

         Where ``<id>`` is the name of the :term:`workflow` and ``<flow>`` is the
         identifier of the :term:`flow`.

         This new flow will catch up and merge with the old one, the workflow
         will then continue as normal.

         Now we have started the new flow we can stop the original one::

            # stop the original flow
            cylc stop <id> --flow <flow>

         The new flow will now continue to run to the end.

         It is also possible to have multiple :term:`flows <flow>` running in the
         scheduler :term:`schduler` simultaneously.

   event handlers
   handlers

      .. seealso::

         - :ref:`Event Handling documentation <EventHandling>`
         - Task events configuration reference: 
           :cylc:conf:`task events <[runtime][<namespace>][events]>`.
         - Workflow events configuration reference: 
           :cylc:conf:`workflow events <[scheduler][events]>`
      
      An action you want the Cylc scheduler to run when it detects that an
      event has occurred:

      - For the :term:`scheduler`; for example startup, stall or shutdown.
      - For a :term:`task`; for example when the :term:`task state` changes to
        succeeded, failed or submit-failed.

      This allows Cylc to centralize automated handling of critical events.
      Cylc can do many things when it detects an event.

      Possible use-cases include (but are not limited to):

      - Send an email message.
      - Run a Cylc command.
      - Run _any_ user-specified script or command.
