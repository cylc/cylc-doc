Tutorial Summary
================

You've made it to the end of the Cylc tutorial!

The Cylc tutorial aims to introduce you to the main concepts in Cylc to
prepare you for working with and writing Cylc workflows.
But there is so much more we didn't have time for.

:ref:`Rose Tutorial <Rose Tutorial>`
   `Rose`_ is a tool for creating configurable applications. It's often used
   with Cylc to configure more complex tasks, or even the workflow itself.
   
   Rose configurations can have metadata, support validation and can be edited
   using a GUI.
   
   You might want to try the :ref:`Rose Tutorial` if these things are of interest.
:ref:`Further Topics <tutorials.furthertopics>`
   There some extra tutorials which cover some of the things the main tutorial
   doesn't in the :ref:`further topics section <tutorials.furthertopics>`.
`Discourse`_
   If you get stuck, encounter an issue, have a question, or just fancy a chat
   about Cylc, feel free to reach out to the Cylc community on our `Discourse`_
   forum.
   
   We also make announcements (e.g. new Cylc releases) on the forum, so it's a
   good to keep an eye on it.
:ref:`User Guide <user guide>`
   There is a comprehensive :ref:`user guide` which goes into Cylc's
   capabilities in detail.
:ref:`Workflow Design Guide <workflow design guide>`
   This covers recommended code style and best practice.
:ref:`Reference <reference>`
   The reference section contains all sorts of technical details.

   It also lists all of the configurations Cylc supports for workflow
   definition :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc`, and for site/user setup
   :cylc:conf:`global.cylc`.
