.. _Workflow Run Databases:

Workflow Run Databases
----------------------

Schedulers maintain two ``sqlite`` databases to record
information on run history:

.. code-block:: console

   $HOME/cylc-run/<workflow-id>/log/db  # public workflow DB
   $HOME/cylc-run/<workflow-id>/.service/db  # private workflow DB

The private DB is for use only by the :term:`scheduler`. The identical
public DB is provided for use by external commands such as
``cylc workflow-state``, and ``cylc report-timings``.
If the public DB gets locked for too long by
an external reader, the :term:`scheduler` will eventually delete it and
replace it with a new copy of the private DB, to ensure that both correctly
reflect the workflow state.

You can interrogate the public DB with the ``sqlite3`` command line tool,
the ``sqlite3`` module in the Python standard library, or any other
sqlite interface.

.. code-block:: console

   $ sqlite3 ~/cylc-run/foo/log/db << _END_
   > .headers on
   > select * from task_events where name is "foo";
   > _END_
   name|cycle|time|submit_num|event|message
   foo|1|2017-03-12T11:06:09Z|1|submitted|
   foo|1|2017-03-12T11:06:09Z|1|output completed|started
   foo|1|2017-03-12T11:06:09Z|1|started|
   foo|1|2017-03-12T11:06:19Z|1|output completed|succeeded
   foo|1|2017-03-12T11:06:19Z|1|succeeded|

The diagram shown below contains the database tables, their columns,
and how the tables are related to each other. For more details on how
