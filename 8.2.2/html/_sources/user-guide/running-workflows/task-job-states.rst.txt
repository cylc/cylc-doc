Task & Job States
=================

**Tasks** are a workflow abstraction; they represent future and past jobs as
well as current active jobs. In the Cylc UI, task states have monochromatic
icons like this: |task-running|.

**Jobs** represent real job scripts submitted to run
on a :term:`job platform`. In the Cylc UI, job states have coloured icons like
this: |job-running|.

A single task can have multiple jobs, by automatic retry or manual triggering.


.. table::

   ============== ==================== =================== ====================================
   State          Task Icon            Job Icon            Description
   ============== ==================== =================== ====================================
   waiting        |task-waiting|                           waiting on prerequisites
   preparing      |task-preparing|                         job being prepared for submission
   submitted      |task-submitted|     |job-submitted|     job submitted
   running        |task-running|       |job-running|       job running
   succeeded      |task-succeeded|     |job-succeeded|     job succeeded
   failed         |task-failed|        |job-failed|        job failed
   submit-failed  |task-submit-failed| |job-submit-failed| job submission failed
   expired        |task-expired|                           will not submit job (too far behind)
   ============== ==================== =================== ====================================

The running task icon contains a clock face which shows the time elapsed
as a proportion of the average runtime.

Task Modifiers
--------------

Tasks are run as soon as their dependencies are satisfied, however, there are
some other conditional which can prevent tasks from being run. These are
given "modifier" icons which appear to the top-left of the task icon:

.. list-table::
   :class: grid-table
   :align: left
   :widths: 20, 80

   * - .. image:: ../../img/task-job-icons/task-isHeld.png
          :width: 60px
          :height: 60px
     - **Held:** Task has been manually :term:`held <held task>` back from
       running.
   * - .. image:: ../../img/task-job-icons/task-isRunahead.png
          :width: 60px
          :height: 60px
     - **Runahead:** Task is held back by the :term:`runahead limit`.
   * - .. image:: ../../img/task-job-icons/task-isQueued.png
          :width: 60px
          :height: 60px
     - **Queued:** Task has been held back by an :term:`internal queue`.
