# Summary

Cylc is a workflow engine for orchestrating complex distributed *suites* of
inter-dependent cycling (repeating) tasks, as well as ordinary non-cycling
workflows. It has been widely adopted for weather, climate, and related
forecasting applications in research and production HPC environments, and it is
now part of the official software infrastructure for the Unified Model
atmospheric model. Cylc is written in Python and developed primarily by NIWA
(NZ) and Met Office (UK). It has strong support for large production systems,
but ease of use for individuals with smaller workflow automation requirements
remains a key priority. Despite its origins, Cylc is not in any way specialized
to environmental forecasting.

In cycling workflows tasks repeat on sequences that may represent forecast
cycles, chunks of a simulation too long for a single run, steps in some
multi-program iterative process (e.g. for optimizing model parameters), or
datasets to be processed as they are generated or received, and so forth.
Cycling in Cylc is controlled by ISO 8601 datetime recurrence expressions
(e.g. for environmental forecasting), or integer recurrence expressions (e.g.
for iterative processes). Dependence across cycles creates ongoing, potentially
never-ending, workflows (rather than simply a succession of disconnected single
workflows). Cylc is unique in its ability to manage these workflows without
imposing a global cycle loop, so that one cycle does not have to complete
before the next can start. Instead, Cylc's novel meta-scheduling algorithm runs
cycles concurrently to the full extent allowed by task dependencies. So, for
example, on restarting after extended downtime, a workflow that processes
real-time data can clear its backlog and catch up very quickly by interleaving
cycles.

As a distributed system, Cylc scales sideways: each workflow is managed by its
own lightweight server program. Existing scripts or programs can be used
without modification in Cylc tasks: they are automatically wrapped in code to
trap errors and report run status via authenticated HTTPS messages or polling.
Cylc workflows are defined with a graph notation that efficiently expresses
dependence between tasks; and task runtime properties (what to run, and where
and how to run the job) are defined in an inheritance hierarchy for efficient
sharing of common settings. Tasks can depend on the wall clock and arbitrary
external events, as well as on the status of other tasks (*submitted*,
*started*, *succeeded*, *failed*, etc.). Dependence between workflows is also
supported: for coupled systems you can choose between a large suite that
controls all tasks, and many smaller suites that depend on each other.

Other features of Cylc include a comprehensive command line interface and GUI;
restart from workflow state snapshots with automatic determination of the fate
of orphaned jobs; support for common HPC resource managers and batch systems
(PBS, Slurm, etc.) as well as background jobs; edit run (manually modify a job
script at the last minute); configurable automatic retries; flexible event
handling; simulation and dummy modes; support for the Jinja2 template processor 
in workflow definitions; internal queues to limit job submission; and conditional
triggering. Major items on the development roadmap include a web GUI and port
to Python 3.
